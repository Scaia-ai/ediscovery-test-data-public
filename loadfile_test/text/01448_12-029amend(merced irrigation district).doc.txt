a.	Part 5(m) is amended in its entirety and replaced with the following:

(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, “X”) may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, “Y”) in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X’s Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X’s Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, “Owed” shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.

Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.

Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.

(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.”

2.	Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(B) with respect to the “Threshold” is hereby amended in its entirety and replaced with the following:

3.	Paragraph 13(g), Holding and Using Posted Collateral is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:


	“(g)	Holding and Using Posted Collateral.

(i)  Eligibility to Hold Posted Collateral; Custodians.  Party A and its Custodian will be entitled to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to Paragraph 6(b); provided that the following conditions applicable to it are satisfied:

(2) Posted Collateral may be held only in the following jurisdictions:  Any jurisdiction within the United States.


(3) The Custodian is a Qualified Institution (as defined below), approved by Party B (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Custodian shall hold the Posted Collateral in a segregated, safekeeping or custody account within the Custodian with the title of such account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the ownership of Party B, subject to the security interest of Party A.


Party B and its Custodian will be entitled to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to Paragraph 6(b); provided that the following conditions applicable to it are satisfied:

The Custodian shall hold the Posted Collateral in a segregated, safekeeping or custody account within the Custodian with the title of such account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the ownership of Party A, subject to the security interest of Party B.


If a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to this Section, then it shall be considered a “Downgraded Party” or a “Downgraded Custodian”, as the case may be (as defined in Paragraph 13(g)(ii)) and Posted Collateral shall be maintained in accordance with Paragraph 13(g)(ii).


(ii)  Use of Posted Collateral.

The provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will apply to the parties; provided, however, that if a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to Paragraph 13(g)(i) (the event that caused it or its Custodian, if any, to be ineligible to hold Posted Collateral shall be a “Credit Rating Event”; if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party, such party shall be the “Downgraded Party”; and if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party’s Custodian, such Custodian shall be the “Downgraded Custodian”), then:


(1)  the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will not apply with respect to the Downgraded Party as the Secured Party for so long as both the Secured Party or its Custodian, if any, remain a Downgraded Party or a Downgraded Custodian, respectively.


(2)  the Downgraded Party shall be required to deliver (or cause the Downgraded Custodian to deliver, as the case may be) not later than the close of business on the second Local Business Day following such Credit Rating Event all Posted Collateral in its possession or held on its behalf to a commercial bank or trust company organized under the law of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, with a Credit Rating of at least “A-” in the case of S&P or “A3” in the case of Moody’s (“Qualified Institution”), approved by the non-Downgraded Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to a segregated, safekeeping or custody account (“Collateral Account”) within such Qualified Institution with the title of the Collateral Account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the Downgraded Party; provided, that, if the Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party’s Custodian that is holding Posted Collateral on behalf of such party, then such Downgraded Custodian may also deliver such Posted Collateral to such party.  The Qualified Institution shall serve as Custodian with respect to the Posted Collateral in the Collateral Account, and shall hold such Posted Collateral in accordance with the terms of this Annex and for the security interest of the Downgraded Party and, subject to such security interest, for the ownership of the non-Downgraded Party.


(3)   So long as the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) do not apply, the Qualified Institution holding the Posted Collateral will invest and reinvest or procure the investment and reinvestment of the Posted Collateral in accordance with the written instructions of the Pledgor, subject to the approval of such instructions by the Secured Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that the Qualified Institution shall not be required to so invest or reinvest or procure such investment or reinvestment if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Pledgor shall have occurred and be continuing.  The Secured Party shall have no responsibility for any losses resulting from any investment or reinvestment effected in accordance with the Pledgor’s instructions.

(iii)  For purposes of Section 5(a)(iii) of this Agreement, failure by a party or its Custodian to comply with any of the obligations under this Paragraph 13(g) will constitute an Event of Default with respect to such party if the failure continues for two (2) Local Business Days after notice of the failure is given to that party.”

(ii)  Transfer of Interest Amount.  The Transfer of the Interest Amount will be made on the last Local Business Day of each calendar month and on any Local Business Day that Posted Collateral in the form of Cash is Transferred to the Pledgor pursuant to Paragraph 3(b).  If Transfer of an Interest Amount (or any portion thereof) to a Pledgor on any day would result in, or increase, a Delivery Amount (treating the day as a Valuation Date, as provided in Paragraph 6(d)(ii)) but the Pledgor would nonetheless have no obligation to make a Transfer pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) on that day if it were a Valuation Date (because the Delivery Amount is lower than the Pledgor’s Minimum Transfer Amount or otherwise), the Secured Party will be required to Transfer that Interest Amount (or portion thereof) to the Pledgor, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 6(d)(ii).”

5.	The definition of “Value” contained in Paragraph 13(j)(i) is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
