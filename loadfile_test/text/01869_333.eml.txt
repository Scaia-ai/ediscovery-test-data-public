Recall that you provided invoices for the purpose of attachments to demand letters for live non-pay CPs.  The letters have begun to go out.  I suspect some CPs will notify us of their intention to either 1) pay or 2) not-pay based upon some specific grounds.  For those CPs that don't respond at all as well as those who indicate that they will pay, I need to know who we should contact to determine weather payment was received.  

Please provide a contact person for this task.

Thanks
