Sorry i could not join you Sunday - Bear needed her bath.  I give her a bath in the morning, so by mid-afternoon she is dry.  Her breeder & doctor suggested we refrain from evening baths--so she does not go to bed wet. In fact part of her Sunday includes an afternoon walk.

Lunch @ Little Pappasito's on Saturday would be great.  Lets shoot for that.

I will tell Lilly that you are up to walking.  If we can all have lunch at
Little Pappasitto's that would  be great.  Whatever you think.  I always
love seeing you.  Lilly and I walked by ourselves on Sunday morning.  David
had t work.
