Contracts Short Outline

Theories of which promises are enforceable

Will theory – parties intend promises to be legally enforceable (objective intention)

Traditional Consideration Model – if promise bargained for, then its valid

Promissory Estoppel – Reliance – If someone relies on promise to their detriment, contract is enforceable 

Circular argument b/c every unmet expectation is detrimental

Reliance must be reasonable

Efficiency – economic argument (2 ways – positive and normative)

Positive – what is law and is it efficient

Normative – objective of legal laws and rules is efficiency

Allocative efficiency – person who values thing most gets it

Only useful for transactions w/ sophisticated business parties

Substantive Fairness – enforce promises that are fair

Who decides what’s fair?

Process-Based – as long as fair process, we’ll enforce


Is there a Contract?

Express v. Implied

Express – oral or written words
Implied contract: conduct
Unilateral v. Bilateral

Unilateral – exchange of offeror’s promise for offeree’s act

Bilateral – both sides make promises

Did party have authority to sign?

Actual – manifestation from principle to agent (“You can enter into contract”)

Apparent – manifestation to third party (e.g. putting someone in teller’s uniform)

Did party have authority to make contract? – need apparent authority or authority by estoppel (See Grouse)

Principal knew or should have known agent creating belief

Principal could have corrected belief at reasonable costs 

Third party relies to detriment on belief

Is there an offer? (manifestation willingness to make a bargain)

Need intent for promise to be legally enforceable (See Bailey v. West)

Objective theory

Where evidence of intent ambiguous ( existing as soon as mutual assent is reached

Law doesn’t create where parties don’t intend (Cohen – just moral obligation to withhold name, not contract)
TEST: Could the person have accepted? Would reasonable person think s/he had just been empowered to accept a contract? (Southworth – letter to sell land seemed like offer; Bretz)
Not valid if made in jest

But valid if reasonable person believes intended agreement (Lucy v. Zehmer)

Solicitations are not offers

Advertisements not offers unless they contain specific words of commitment

Must be clear and definite (Lonergan)

Lefkerowitz – ad for stole for $1 offer because stated means of acceptance – “first come, first served”  - clear, definite and explicit

Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball – says anyone who performs conditions (using product) won’t get sick, so there is valid contract

Leonard v. Pepsico – reasonable person wouldn’t think commercial was offer to sell jet

Offerror is master of the offer

Takes affect when received

Can revoke (R §36) prior to acceptance (See Equitable Life)
Can’t revoke with detrimental reliance (See Drennan v. Star Paving – bids by subcontractors)
Revocation takes account when received
Is there acceptance?

Ways of accepting

Words

Acts – performance

Full performance = acceptance

Partial performance means irrevocable for reasonable time with unilateral contract and acceptance with bilateral

Need to notify

Reliance (See Drennan v. Star Paving – relies on contract)

Silence (R §69) – only works where offerree normally accepts service; past dealings) (Ammons)
Effective upon dispatch/when sent (MAILBOX Rule) (Adams v. Lindsel; Hendricks v. Behee)
May only be accepted by person who offeror intended to give a power of acceptance

Must know of offer (Glover – can’t get reward for disclosure of info. if you don’t know about reward)
Would reasonable offeror consider response to be acceptance? (Russell v. Texas – continued to use land, but didn’t really want to accept permit)
If reasonable person would believe you accepted, then you did

Offerror dictates means of acceptances
Need to have power to accept on someone’s behalf (See La Salle)

If no time specified, use reasonable time standard (See Ever-Tite)

Conditional acceptances or counter-offers are not acceptances

Accommodation shipping (nonconforming goods) is actually a counter-offer, not acceptance as long as seller reasonably notifies buyer of such (Corinthian Pharmaceutical)
Is there consideration? – bargained for performance or return promise

Benefit to promisor or legal detriment to promise/bargained for
Can’t just be gratuitous promise (Kirksey v. Kirksey)

Forebearance from pursuing uncertain legal claims (See Fiege v. Boehm)
Good faith belief

Reasonable belief

Langer v. Superior Steel Corp. – pension on condition he didn’t work for competitor

Can have implied duty (Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon)

Need value
Just in eyes of promisor (Haigh v. Brooks)

Can have risk element (Apfel-Prudential -  not sure if something is patentable

Motives irrelevant (See Thomas v. Thomas; Industrial America)

Mutuality Test – can both parties breach?

Inducement Test – is condition what made promise make promise? (Hamer v. Sidway – uncle gives nephew $5,000)
Breach Test – could either party breach?

Quasi Contract (contract implied in law; unjust enrichment; moral obligation)

Expectation of compensation

Not in Manwill v. Oyler

Material benefit was conferred (e.g. Webb v. McGowin – P saved D’s life)
B appreciated and retained benefit (knowledge + opportunity to reject)
Need pre-existing obligation, not just past benefit (See Mills v. Wyman – father promises to pay for care of adult son and revokes promise)
Can’t be volunteer (Harrington v. Taylor)

Unjust not to compensate A
Can have preexisting legal obligation that becomes inoperative – discharged debt; obligation while a minor

Promissory Estoppel (R § 90) (Ricketts v. Scothorm – grandfather said he’d pay granddaughter so she didn’t have to work; Grouse v. Group Health – offered job and resigned from old job; Feinberg v. Pfeffer - pension)
Rule (Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores)

Clear and definite promise (added in Cohen v. Cowles Media)

Reasonable and foreseeable for promissory to expect it would induce reliance

Cohen v. Cowles Media added intention requirement

Detrimental reliance

Enforcement necessary to avoid injustice

Only applies when there is no contract (See All-Tech Telecom)

Writing - Usually not sufficient, but sometimes under UCC

What doesn’t count?
Nominal (e.g. peppercorn) (In re Greene)
Form (seal)

Pre-existing duty (See Levine v. Blumenthal; Alaska Packers; Angel v. Murray)

Just reduces standards of economic duress

Forebearance from invalid claims (In re Greene)
Past consideration

Illusory promise – party has unfettered discretion whether to perform (Rehm-Zeiher)

Is there mutual assent? (meeting of the minds)

Determined by expressed intention, not secret intention – what reasonable party would understand (Embry)

Peerless case (Raffles v. Wichelhaus) – agreed on different ships so no consent

Is there mutual obligation?

If one party can withdraw after performance begins, no mutual obligation (Rehm-Zeiher)

Can be based on implied duty (Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon – implied promise to exert reasonable efforts to gain endorsemensts)

Can still have conditions (required feasibility report – Omni Group)

What happens in event of breach? – REMEDIES 

Specific performance

No adequate remedy at law

Land contracts (e.g. tomatoes – Curtice Brothers)
Expectation damages – puts plaintiff in position as if contract had been performed

Hard to show expected value, so rely on market price as proxy

Can use actual losses if you can prove (American Mechanical)

Based on date of breach

Limited by

Foseeability (See Hadley v. Baxendale – stoppage of mill not foreseeable)
R §351

Party has mitigated

Only if reasonable

Also get reasonable mitigation costs

Selling to someone else isn’t mitigation unless there’s lost volume (Locks v. Wade)

Loss can be proven with sufficient certainty (e.g. amount of lost profits)
Cost of completion (New Era Homes) v. diminution in value (just get difference in value when wrong pipe installed – Jacob & Youngs v. Kent)

If breach is willful, better case for cost of completion (Groves)

Idea behind diminution in value is don’t want economic waste

Diminution in value if provision breached was only incidental to contract (Peevyhouse); if work not incidental get cost of completion (American Standard)

Reliance – puts plaintiff in position as if contract had never been made

reimburses for loss – what justice requires
Typical remedy for promissory estoppel or unjust enrichment
Damages equal to amount spent in performing or trying to perform

Limited by contract price/expectation damages

Subtract amount of loss P would have suffered with performance from damages

Losing Contracts (expectation damages would be nothing or negative) (L. Albert & Son)

Hoffman v. Red Owl – get difference b/w fair market value and sale of store, not lost profits

Restitution – restores to plaintiff any benefit conferred on other party

Idea is to present unjust enrichment

Based on market value rendered to defendant
Not limited to contract price, but usually not above that

Not available when P has fully performed and D only owes money

Smaller than expectation/reliance except in losing parties

Disgorgement – gives plaintiff any gains breaching party gains by breaching (e.g. sell product to someone else for more and give extra profit)
Typical remedy if agent breaches fiduciary duty (e.g. breach of loyalty)
Idea is that something is taken wrongfully
Punitive

Tort-like conduct, gross negligence or fraud

Take into account totality of circumstances in evaluating (See Boise – fraud in selling car)

Reasonable relationship b/w actual and punitive damages

Can have for bad faith (Acquista – didn’t give amount required for disability policy)

NOTE: Can recover for psychological injury (See Sullivan – damages from value of nose after botched operation) or emotional/mental harm (See Bohac; Acquista) if reasonably foreseeable consequential damages




Holmes – efficient breach hypothesis – can always choose between performance and paying damages
