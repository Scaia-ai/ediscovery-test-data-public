Magic Quadrant  
for Business Process Management Suites

Gartner RAS Core Research Note G00164485, Janelle B. Hill, Michele Cantara, Marc Kerremans, Daryl C. Plummer,18 February 2009, RA7 06162009

Gartner has revised its BPMS Magic Quadrant to focus the 
analysis on product support for the use cases, rather than 
product features and functions. This change has altered our 
assessment of the relative strengths of the vendors since our 
2007 Magic Quadrant.
 

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
This document was revised on 24 February 2009. For more information,  
see the corrections page on gartner.com

Gartner’s updated Magic Quadrant represents one of several tools clients can use to evaluate this 
market. The 2009 Magic Quadrant depicts the relative strengths of the top 22 vendors offering 
multiregional, cross-industry business process management suites (BPMSs) that interest Gartner 
clients and nonclients the most. These vendors account for most spending in the BPMS market. 
However, customers should also consider other vendors that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 
such as those specializing in industry-specific processes or in particular geographic locations.

The position of vendors in the 2009 BPMS Magic Quadrant has changed more than usual, 
because we have altered one of the key evaluation criteria from product capabilities to four 
use cases that the products support:
•	 Implementation	of	an	industry-	or	company-specific	process	composition
•	 Support	for	a	continuous	process	improvement	mentality
•	 A	business	transformation	initiative
•	 Redesign	for	a	process-based	service-oriented	architecture	(SOA)

The original business process management (BPM) pure-play vendors have the longest history 
of model-driven process execution (as opposed to code-based execution), which Gartner 
thinks	is	the	best	way	to	enable	business	and	IT	professionals	to	manage	and	change	
processes collaboratively, especially in a volatile business environment. For this reason, many 
of these vendors have advanced to the Leaders quadrant in the BPMS Magic Quadrant.

However, most of the large middleware and software infrastructure vendors now recognize 
the importance of this shift to business professional empowerment in the process life cycle 
and are strengthening their BPMS products. SAP is included in this Magic Quadrant for 
the	first	time.	Nevertheless,	products	from	IBM,	Oracle,	Software	AG,	EMC,	and	SAP	have	
not yet been proven to address all of the BPMS use cases – even in vision – with user 
experiences not as seamless and unified as the products from the smaller, best-of-breed 
providers. Sheer marketing and sales can’t overcome this weakness.

Thus, clients should not conclude that products from all of the leaders are necessarily the 
best	products	in	the	market.	In	fact,	the	products	from	the	niche	players	Polymita	and	



2
Ultimus are architecturally more unified and, 
thus, deliver a stronger BPM user experience 
than	those	from	IBM	(a	leader)	and	Oracle	
(a	challenger),	for	example	(see	Figure	1).	In	
other words, although Polymita and Ultimus 
have	strong	products,	IBM	and	Oracle	are	
stronger contenders overall in the market as 
we have defined it.

MAGIC QUADRANT

Interpreting the 2009 Magic 
Quadrant Graphic
Our	2009	BPMS	Magic	Quadrant	graphic	
reflects a change in our evaluation approach. 
Previously, we based our judgments about 
vendor strengths in this market on the functions 
of their products. For this Magic Quadrant, 
we based our judgments on support for our 
four BPM use cases (described below).This 
approach will better address our clients’ BPM 
project and program requirements.

We considered more than 40 providers 
worldwide for our 2009 Magic Quadrant, 
of which 22 met the inclusion criteria (see 
below). Thus, the Magic Quadrant graphs the 
relative strength of the top vendors offering 
multiregional, cross-industry BPMSs that 
interest Gartner clients and nonclients the 
most. These vendors account for most of the 
spending in the BPMS market.

The number of leaders and the overall dot 
pattern reflect our purposeful inclusion of the 
top 22 vendors. All the dots representing the 
vendors have moved slightly downward since 2007, 
because we shifted our evaluation from BPMS 
functions to the BPMS’s ability to address the four use cases described 
below. Leaders address all four. Niche players excel at one or two only. 
Challengers and visionaries vary in the breadth and depth of support for 
the use cases.

Because we included the top 22 providers, the clustering of 
the dots may seem to indicate a maturing market and a lack of 
differentiation across providers. (Clients often mention that all 
these products “look alike.”) Lack of differentiation often precedes 
market consolidation; however, this market has nuances that 
are not readily apparent from the graphic. For example, we have 
included	a	mix	of	.NET	and	Java	products	from	all	over	the	world.	
Small and midsize enterprises, especially outside the U.S., often 

prefer a Microsoft-centric solution and have radically different BPM 
requirements and priorities than large enterprises. Furthermore, 
Microsoft’s mass-market approach sets buyers’ expectations for 
pricing, sales channels and skills.

Outside	the	U.S.,	many	small	companies	use	indirect	sales	channels,	
including resellers, partners, consulting firms and system integrators. 
Thus, many small BPMS providers can gain a large customer base 
spreading across multiple geographic locations at a relatively low cost 
compared	to	the	Java	providers.	In	addition,	Intalio’s	open-source	
product and SAP’s NetWeaver BPM offer two more approaches to 
satisfying BPM requirements. Given all of these nuances, we encourage 
clients to read the entire Magic Quadrant report and call Gartner to 
discuss their specific needs further.

Finally, clients should bear in mind that this is a market analysis, 
not simply a product analysis. Product evaluation is only one of 
many criteria applied. Therefore, do not conclude that products 
from	all	of	the	leaders	are	the	best	products	in	the	market.	In	fact,	
products from niche players (as well as some of the visionary 
vendors) are architecturally more unified, thus delivering a stronger 
BPM	user	experience	than	those	from	IBM,	Tibco,	Software	AG,	
EMC	and	Oracle.

Market Overview
Overall,	2008	marked	a	turning	point	for	BPM	as	a	discipline.	
Hundreds of interactions with enterprises lead us to conclude that 
they are scaling up their efforts to establish BPM as an enterprise 
program – not just apply its methods and technologies to one-off 
projects. A BPMS should support BPM throughout the business 
process life cycle. Key elements of the BPM discipline are:

•	 Optimizing	the	performance	of	end-to-end	business	processes	
that span functions, as well as processes that might extend 
beyond the enterprise to include partners, suppliers and 
customers

•	 Making	the	business	process	visible	(and	thus	explicit)	to	
business	and	IT	constituents	through	business	process	
modeling, monitoring and optimization

•	 Keeping	the	business	process	model	in	sync	with	process	
execution

•	 Empowering	business	users	and	analysts	to	manipulate	a	
business process model to modify instances of the process

•	 Enabling	rapid	iteration	of	processes	and	underlying	systems	for	
continuous process improvement and optimization

Since 2000, the financial services industry (retail and investment 
banks, as well as insurance) has led the aggressive adoption of BPMS 
technology. Many leading financial service institutions are consolidating 
their project implementations into a more coordinated BPM program. 
BPM has mostly been embraced in service industries where human 
productivity and effectiveness are key to process performance.

Through 2008, many enterprises have implemented multiple 
projects and often use products from multiple vendors. Many 
clients have three or more BPMSs. During the current financial 
crisis, Gartner expects many of these enterprises to consolidate 
their BPM technologies in 2009, while expanding their efforts – that 
is, they will have fewer BPMS vendors, but will make more use of 
those they keep.

In	2008,	one	of	the	biggest	changes	in	this	market	is	the	increase	
in the number of buyers looking to support continuous process 
improvement and drive business transformation with BPM. For 
example, in 2007, our anecdotal evidence found only two out of 
10 Gartner clients expressed these requirements, compared with 
five out of 10 in 2008. Furthermore, in our 2008 primary research 
survey on BPM adoption, respondents said they expected the 
following benefits from BPM:

•	 Continuous	process	improvement	–	53%

•	 Transformational	–	10%

•	 Incremental	gains	–	15%

•	 Substantial	benefits	–	21%

•	 Don’t	know	–	1%

In	the	current	economic	crisis,	BPM	initiatives	(and	BPMS	products)	
seem to be some of the few projects receiving funding.

BPMS vendors that have evolved from a BPM pure-play heritage 
continue to lead the market in capabilities and vision, but large 
middleware and software infrastructure vendors have greatly 
expanded their market presence. The vision of vendors such as 
Oracle	and	SAP	aligns	more	closely	with	the	business	process	
platform (BPP) concept than the BPMS use cases. We expect that 
the use cases for a BPMS will evolve as application infrastructure 
and composition technologies continue to evolve into model-driven, 
integrated composition environments that support businesses’ 
desire to formalize a BPP.

Microsoft is not represented, because it does not offer a BPMS; 
rather, Microsoft relies on partners to use its Windows Workflow 
Foundation technology and supplement Microsoft’s application 
platform with BPM functionality. This analysis includes a number of 
strong Microsoft partners.

Market Definition/Description
Our	2009	BPMS	Magic	Quadrant	reflects	a	significant	change	in	
Gartner’s approach to evaluating vendors and products to meet the 
needs	of	buyers.	In	previous	versions,	Gartner	defined	the	market	
according to technical features and functions, such as process 
engines or modeling environments. As software infrastructure 
markets began to shift toward application infrastructure, we started 
to shift our Magic Quadrants to define markets based on use 
cases, rather than product categories.

For our 2009 update, we have shifted our focus to defining the 
BPMS market based on the top four use cases that BPMSs support. 
This focus better reflects an essential ingredient in the appeal of 
BPMS, namely, business professionals can see work in progress (via 
models) and manage and execute dynamic business    processes 
without	exclusive	reliance	on	IT	professionals	to	make	desired	
changes to the process specification. Also, business professionals 
can	collaborate	with	IT	professionals	more	easily	and	consistently	
throughout the process improvement life cycle by using models to 
provide a shared language and, thus, improved understanding.

Top Four BPM Use Cases
At a macro level, the use case for a BPMS involves a buyer 
looking	for	technology	to	support	its	BPM	project	or	program.	In	
most cases, buyers want to create business-process abstraction 
layers for their applications and services (hosted on an application 
infrastructure). Gartner has observed four main use cases in BPMS 
buying behavior on which we base our definition of the 2009 BPMS 
market. (These are not mutually exclusive.)

Implementation of a Specific Process-Based Application
The	business	(supported	by	the	IT	organization)	tends	to	buy	a	
BPMS to improve business performance through broader and 
better coordination of a specific mission-critical process. This 
process is often unique to the industry or to the differentiation 
of the enterprise. As such, it is not commercially available. 
Furthermore, the business seeks a rapid implementation of the 
new application ideally built as an extension and unification of 
established applications and data. The end result is a composite 
application reflecting the end-to-end process view, not just an 
integration of data and transactions.



4
Support for a Continuous Process Improvement Mentality
In	this	situation,	the	business	and	IT	organizations	regularly	
collaborate on technology decisions to deliver management 
visibility and agility for key processes. The BPM program is 
led by the director of process improvement and a governance 
council or equivalent. The business process competency center 
offers the methodologies and services to support the execution 
of the BPM program. A BPMS is selected to provide a stable 
platform, with integrated services to use to deliver continuous 
process improvements.

Redesign for a Process-Based SOA
Here,	the	IT	organization	drives	business	enthusiasm	for	BPM	
to	help	prioritize	IT’s	efforts	to	rationalize	and	modernize	the	
application	portfolio	for	SOA.	The	IT	organization	buys	a	BPMS	as	
a model-driven environment that uses explicit process models to 
drive greater business involvement in decisions that prioritize its 
implementation	of	an	SOA,	while	enabling	process	transparency	
and agility for business.

Business Transformation Initiatives
Senior business executives drive buying decisions in this use 
case. They want to make a “game changing” play by rethinking 
an entire business process. The ability to create shared process 
understanding across stakeholders (through modeling, analysis 
and simulation), synchronize execution with the model and 
support rapid innovation makes the BPMS approach highly 
attractive. These buyers highly value the enhanced collaboration 
between	business	and	IT.

Use Case Characteristics
All four use cases exhibit most of the following characteristics.

Business-Oriented Models
The business professions want a view of the process that is tailored 
specifically to their level of comprehension and sensibility, and 
selectively avoids the complex technology that is more relevant to 
service orchestration.

Unified Process
The enterprise wants to overlay its application assets with a 
business-level representation of the end-to-end processes that 
these assets support. Business leaders especially want visibility 
into the end-to-end processes, not just the individual contributing 
resources. The enterprise needs to coordinate the human efforts, 
the business rules, the information flows and the automated tasks, 
as well as gain visibility into the interactions across these resources, 
to improve manageability.

Exception Handling
The enterprise wants to automate exception handling (a costly, manual 
effort) in conformity with the standard process. A rule engine in a 
BPMS abstracts the business policies that can be applied to exception 
conditions	across	multiple	process	contexts.	In	other	words,	the	
outcome of continuous improvement results in an environment without 
exceptions, or, at least, with far fewer exceptions.

Industry-Specific Process
The enterprise chooses a BPMS, rather than the more traditional 
hand-coded application approach, to automate a process that 
is unique to its industry or differentiates the enterprise within the 
industry. The process requires coordination of manual efforts, 

system-automated tasks and information flows (often documents, 
forms, and other semi-structured or unstructured content).

Prebuilt Content
The enterprise seeks some prebuilt business process content 
(sometimes seen as a distillation of industry best practice) to 
incorporate into its model-driven composition environment and to 
accelerate its learning and implementation.

Management Control
The enterprise wants visibility into work in progress, insight into 
how specific in-flight transactions affect process performance 
indicators and, perhaps, the capability to adjust transactions for 
optimal outcomes. Adjustments range from changing the data 
for the business transaction to dynamically handling exceptions 
to changing the process, such as eliminating tasks, adding extra 
approval steps, redirecting the work item, skipping ahead or 
applying alternative business rules.

Process Dynamism/Agility
The enterprise buys a BPMS as a model-driven environment to help 
create and manage a process that is highly susceptible to change 
and disruption. These may be caused by internal or external factors, 
including changes in weather patterns, mergers and acquisitions, 
currency fluctuations, consumer preferences, trading-partner actions, 
competitive pricing, regulatory changes (especially in 2009 for 
financial services), geopolitical events and skill availability.

Process Change
The enterprise wants to support process designs that change often 
(four or more times a year). Change is driven by internal factors, 
such as a desire to innovate, a better understanding of the process 
and a continuous improvement method.

Process Roles
The	roles	and	responsibilities	of	business	and	IT	professionals	
in the process improvement life cycle are shifting toward greater 
involvement for business users. Business users want to be involved 
throughout the life cycle, not just during requirements gathering and 
at the end with user acceptance testing (see Note 1).

Note 1
Why Enterprises Adopt BPM
Enterprises	adopt	BPM	because	they	anticipate	frequent	
process changes. From our primary research survey, more 
than two-thirds of organizations using BPM do so because 
they expect to need to change business processes at 
least twice per year. By itself, this finding is unsurprising; 
processes	do	change	from	time	to	time;	however,	18%	
of companies said they needed to change processes at 
least	monthly,	and	10%	said	processes	changed	weekly.	
Another theme that emerged from this data was the impact 
of	unforeseen	events	on	organizations	–	16%	of	companies	
using BPM (or planning to do so) expected to need to 
alter processes ad hoc in response to some triggering 
event.	It	is	not	practical	for	IT	professionals	only	to	change	
processes daily or weekly.



5
Time Span
The enterprise wants to better coordinate long-running business 
transactions in which instances of the work often extend for hours, 
days or even months.

Boundary Crossing
The enterprise chooses a BPMS for business transactions that 
crosses multiple boundaries. This can include organizational 
boundaries, national boundaries (due to different taxes and 
regulations in different countries), boundaries between facilities, 
system boundaries and information boundaries.

BPM adoption has been strongest in the service industries (such 
as banking, insurance, telephone companies and other utilities), 
where the “product” is largely a commodity and in which higher 
customer value is created more through human interactions and 
expertise in servicing the customer than through the product 
itself.	In	comparison,	past	process	management	approaches	were	
largely practiced in manufacturing industries where value lies with 
the product itself, rather than the servicing of the product. Notable 
past process management success stories have come from such 
manufacturers	as	General	Electric,	Intel,	Motorola,	Toyota,	Ford	
Motor, Allied Signal, Cemex and Dell.

BPM Drivers
In	the	past,	process	management	focused	on	efficiency,	which	
is no longer sufficient to compete in today’s global environment. 
Operational	excellence	also	requires	process	agility;	that	is,	the	
ability of a business to change its operations, and the way in which 
its people and systems work to adapt to continuous change. 
Addressing efficiency and agility simultaneously requires continuous 
process improvement. Processes also need to be transparent. 
Accelerated business cycles require management of operations 
in real time. Managing work by using after-the-fact reports is no 
longer good enough. Pressures for information transparency, 
accountability and compliance now require managers to monitor 
transactions more closely, to see them as they unfold. Business 
managers, employees and even external participants want to adjust 
work in progress, not just react to information about completed 
transactions.

A BPM program (versus a one-time process improvement project) 
enables the business to grow and transform in step with these 
changes. BPM disciplines empower business professionals to 
optimize process performance, even when operating conditions are 
more	volatile.	In	this	way,	BPM	is	more	about	the	coordination	of	
resources and the interactions of those resources than automation 
and control. BPMSs are also starting to play a crucial role in 
outsourcing by delivering transparency and visibility across the 
provider and consumer of services.

Description of BPMS
BPMSs are the leading integrated composition environment to 
support BPM and enable continuous improvement. A BPMS is 
an integrated collection of software technologies that enables 
the control and management of business processes. Compared 
with other model-oriented development tools, such as integrated 
service environments and integrated development environments, a 
BPMS emphasizes business user involvement in the entire process 
improvement life cycle. As a discipline, BPM is about coordination, 
rather than control (via automation) over resources.

Beyond task automation, a BPMS coordinates human interactions 
and information flows in support of work tasks. People, information, 
systems and, increasingly, business policies are treated as equally 
important resources that affect the desired work outcome. This 
comprehensive approach to resources also distinguishes a BPMS 
from other emerging model-driven application infrastructure. 

BPMSs use explicit process models to coordinate the interactions 
among people, systems and information as equally important aspects 
of work. This model-driven approach loosely couples the physical 
resources used at execution time with the design of the process 
to increase flexibility. At runtime, the BPM engine acts as a “super 
workflow manager,” coordinating the end-to-end processes, including 
all resources involved, human and machine, regardless of whether 
software resources are created in the BPMS’s design environment or in 
other platforms. (Workflow is not synonymous with a BPMS. Workflow 
is one of many runtime capabilities delivered in a BPMS.) The most 
appropriate processes for a BPMS exhibit these characteristics:

•	 Process	outcomes	depend	on	the	coordination	of	multiple,	
dependent resources. The interaction patterns between the 
resources are not exclusively sequential and predictable. 
Interactions	can	also	be	undetermined	and	collaborative.

•	 Some	critical	aspects	of	the	workflow	are	poorly	understood.	
The BPMS helps uncover better workflows by making their 
execution	visible	and	audited.	Execution	data	history	feeds	into	
the next iteration of the design.

•	 The	process	depends	on	human	collaboration	to	have	an	
impact on outcomes (such as new-product designs, problem 
diagnosis and case-management-style problem domains).

Required Capabilities
BPMSs deliver short-term benefits (such as cost and time savings and 
compliance) and long-term advantages, including visibility into cross-
functional processes, agility to meet changing market and user needs, 
and even revenue growth. To deliver these benefits and to support the 
use cases listed above, BPMSs must have the following functions:

•	 Support	the	modeling	and	analysis	of	business	processes,	including	
all aspects of workflow: tasks, roles, decisions, approvals, reviews, 
escalations, collaborations, flows, rules, policies, forms and other 
documents, events, goals, objectives and scenarios.

•	 Support	process	change	in	the	design	and	the	execution	of	
transactions,	with	auditing.	(In	“round-trip	engineering,”	changes	
made to the model are reflected in the execution, and changes 
to the resources executing the work transactions are fed back 
into the model.)

•	 Coordinate	any	type	of	interaction	pattern	among	users,	system	
tasks and information resources, regardless of the location of 
these	resources.	Interaction	patterns	include	human-to-human,	
system-to-system, human-to-system, human-to-content and 
content interdependencies.

•	 Enable	participants	to	manipulate	and	manage	structured	
and unstructured information within the process, not just as 
referenced attachments to their tasks.

•	 Support	the	definition,	manipulation	and	management	of	
business	rules	by	business	and	IT	users.

•	 Support	user	and	group	collaboration	on	work	items	in	the	
process (in real time and offline). They should enable business 
and	IT	professionals	to	work	together	on	process	design,	
development, execution and enhancement.



6
•	 Support	the	monitoring,	reporting,	analysis	and	notification	

of activities and events that affect work, using data about 
completed and in-progress transactions (in real time and offline).

•	 Support	process	simulation	and	optimization	of	desired	
business outcomes by using real-time, historical and estimated 
data.

•	 Interoperate	with	external	software	assets,	especially	SOA	
Web services, and include these in the end-to-end process 
orchestration.

•	 Enable	management	of	all	process	artifacts	(models,	process	
definitions, rule definitions, service definitions, executables 
and more) throughout the entire process life cycle (discover, 
define, model, simulate, deploy, execute, monitor, analyze and 
optimize) to facilitate reuse and change management.

•	 Include	packaged	business	content,	such	as	sample	process	
models,	rule	sets,	prebuilt	user	interfaces	(UIs)	and	composite	
process frameworks. Packaged content can deliver as much 
as	80%	of	what	the	enterprise	needs.	Much	of	this	content	has	
been free, but vendors are increasingly charging fees for the 
more-sophisticated content.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Gartner included vendors in this Magic Quadrant if they met all of 
these criteria:

•	 The	vendor’s	product	fulfills	all	capabilities	listed	above.

•	 The	vendor	delivers	these	capabilities	as	general-purpose	
technology appropriate for any process and does not specialize 
solely in, for example, new-employee onboarding, call center 
cross-selling or industry-specific processes. The vendor 
markets and sells to the BPMS market, independent of any 
other lines of business.

•	 The	vendor	provides	these	functions	in	one	suite.	Some	functions	
can be sourced from partners, although the BPMS vendor must be 
the single point of contact for customer support.

•	 The	vendor	must	conduct	business	on	two	continents	through	
a local, direct presence (local employees; not partners).

•	 The	product	interests	Gartner	clients,	or	Gartner	analysts	
feel clients should take note of it. We use Dataquest market 
share, Gartner client inquiry data and Gartner BPM conference 
attendee questions as indicators of market interest.

•	 The	product	regularly	competes	against	offerings	from	other	
vendors represented on the Magic Quadrant.

•	 The	vendor	must	provide	references	that	demonstrate	industry	
and geographic diversity. At least one reference must have 
processes using the complete suite. The number of customers 
using the complete suite will be considered in the evaluation.

For	each	vendor,	the	product	version	evaluated	is	indicated.	In	
the section that follows, we indicate vendors considered and our 
reason(s) for excluding them.

Vendors Considered, but Not Included
Some providers did not qualify for inclusion, even though they have 
strong, complete BPMSs that users should consider when their 
process management requirements (including future requirements) 
match these vendors’ offerings. Below, we indicate some vendors 
we considered and our reasons for excluding them.

Autonomy Cardiff
This vendor provides a product built to better handle cognitive, 
nonroutine and dynamic aspects of work; therefore, it does not 
regularly compete in BPMS deals with other vendors on this Magic 
Quadrant.

BizAgi
This vendor has weak functionality in user and group collaboration, 
simulation and optimization, and content management. This vendor 
has not yet gained sufficient interest from Gartner clients worldwide, 
although it has a growing presence in Latin America. Most of its 
customers are in South America.

Everest
Everest’s	Aquima	is	not	a	general-purpose	BPMS,	but	a	
specialized product for dynamic, customer-oriented processes 
in front and mid offices.

HandySoft
HandySoft’s BizFlow is primarily sold through system integrators and 
other indirect channels as part of a solution, rather than sold direct to 
large enterprises as a general-purpose BPMS. As a result, HandySoft 
has not yet gained sufficient market awareness. Nevertheless, BizFlow 
does meet Gartner’s definition of a complete BPMS and offers strong 
capabilities for streamlining nondeterministic processes, such as action 
tracking and correspondence management.

Pallas Athena
This vendor has a complete suite of BPM software tools. Although the 
company has not yet gained significant interest from Gartner clients 
to qualify for the Magic Quadrant, it does have more than 2,200 
customers and covers the complete BPM life cycle, including modeling, 
execution, workflow, and process mining and case management. 
The company has a strong presence in the Netherlands, the U.K. and 
Germany, and it is gaining in other global markets.

PNMsoft
PNMsoft is a fast-growing, U.K.-headquartered provider of 
Microsoft-centric	BPM	technology.	It	has	well-known	customers	
and	business	partners	in	Europe;	however,	insufficient	market	
presence in the U.S. kept it out of the top vendors competing.

Magic Software
Magic Software’s iBolt technology is marketed as a composite 
application	infrastructure,	not	a	BPMS.	In	this	context,	Magic	targets	
iBolt at enterprise application ecosystems to extend the scope and 
functions of the core application through data and process integration. 
When combined with the W4Global offering, the combined functions 
are closer to Gartner’s definition of a BPMS.

Banctec
This	vendor	markets	its	BPMS,	eFIRST	Process,	as	a	stand-
alone product, but focuses more on delivering solutions, such 
as	CenterVision,	built	on	eFIRST	Process.	This	provider	focuses	
on financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, government, 
services and utilities.

Vitria
This	vendor’s	new	offering,	M3O,	is	innovative,	but	too	new	to	
include in this research.

BEA
This	vendor	was	acquired	by	Oracle	in	April	2008.	The	Oracle	entry	
below	reflects	the	products	and	capabilities	it	acquired	through	BEA.

Newgen Technologies
With a heritage in integrated document archive and retrieval systems, 
imaging, content management, and workflow, this vendor, which is 
based	in	India,	has	more	than	725	customers	in	35	countries.	It	is	
rapidly	gaining	clients	in	Africa,	the	Middle	East,	Central	and	Eastern	
Europe,	the	Asia/Pacific	region	and	the	U.S.	What	differentiates	
Newgen is its knowledge of industry best practices in a rapid-delivery 
model designed to provide an exact-fit solution, fully integrated to the 
specific needs of its customers. Nevertheless, Newgen has not yet 
gained sufficient interest for its BPMS from Gartner clients worldwide. 
We do not see it regularly competing in BPMS deals with other vendors 
on this Magic Quadrant.

Dropped: Vendors No Longer in This Magic Quadrant
Microgen
The Aptitude product does best in high-volume transaction 
processing, rather than BPM use cases. Thus, interest among our 
clients for Aptitude as a BPMS has been low. This product does 
not compete regularly with other vendors in this Magic Quadrant.

SunGard
Sungard (see Note 2) does not sell the Carnot engine for general-
purpose	BPMSs,	but	as	part	of	the	Infinity	Process	Platform,	a	
software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. This positioning makes the 
product more of a BPP and does not address the four use cases 
for BPMS. Gartner clients have low interest in Carnot as a BPMS, 
and it does not compete regularly in deals with other vendors on 
this Magic Quadrant.

Captaris
This vendor positioned its technology as workflow, rather than 
enabling	BPM.	It	also	primarily	sold	its	product	as	an	embedded	
engine under a partner’s solution. As a result, insufficient market 
presence and client interest kept it out of the top 25 vendors 
competing.	The	company	was	recently	acquired	by	Open	Text.

Evaluation Criteria

Ability to Execute
Vendors must deliver strong capabilities in all the functional 
areas listed above to achieve long-term leadership in the BPMS 
market. We also heavily weighted sales execution and pricing, 
key measures of market reach and commercial viability. As major 
software vendors enter this market, the smaller, private, best-of-
breed vendors must establish a strong market share to maintain 
their leadership. Marketing execution, along with sales execution, 
creates “mind share”; thus, we have weighted these criteria heavily.

Viability remains an important criterion for buyers. However, 
standards and runtime interoperability with software infrastructure 
products, such as application servers and portals, increase buyers’ 
comfort with smaller, best-of-breed BPMS suppliers. Thus, we 
weighted this criterion as “standard.” Market responsiveness 
and track record is also weighted as “standard”; all vendors ship 
multiple releases or versions in a year. BPMS enables nontechnical 
people to play key roles in process improvement, so we heavily 
weighted	the	customer	experience	criterion	(see	Note	3),	which	
encompasses business-user friendliness, a single-product 
experience and customer support. Finally, the operations criterion 
reflects our evaluation of the management team and how well the 
company works with partners and customers (see Table 1).

Completeness of Vision
Completeness of vision in the BPMS market considers the same types 
of criteria we use to rate a vendor’s ability to execute, but with an eye on 
the future. Vendors have already begun to pursue multiple growth paths, 
such as BPMS, BPP, BPMS-powered SaaS and business process 
outsourcing	(BPO)	models,	but	we	evaluated	their	completeness	of	
vision by how their products and services meet the BPMS use cases

described above. Nevertheless, with so many vendors competing, a 
vendor’s plan for enhancing the product and for meeting the needs of 
new roles continues to be an important selection criterion.

Purchasing decisions are typically split between business and 
IT	professionals;	a	particular	business	process	improvement	
project	drives	the	collaboration	between	the	IT	organization	and	
the business to find a solution. We reduced the weighting of the 
market and sales strategies, because these criteria must support 
the vendors’ understanding of the market; otherwise, their message 
and value proposition will not resonate with buyers.

Because there are so many competitors, we heavily weighted 
product strategy as the criterion that most reflects the vendor’s 
vision for R&D. We asked whether the vendor will develop additional 
features itself, by using open-source technology, partnering or 
acquiring capabilities. A vendor’s product strategy also affects 
customer	experience.	In	the	business	model	criterion,	we	
considered whether the vendor is funded adequately and staffed 
with individuals who we believe can execute the product vision.

We de-emphasized support for industry-specific needs to focus 
on the general-purpose software infrastructure technologies in a 
BPMS. Nevertheless, because there are few standards that relate 
to process templates and frameworks, vendors have an opportunity 
to distinguish themselves and to deliver more value to customers 
in this area. With standards gaining popularity, including Business 
Process	Modeling	Notation	(BPMN),	XPDL,	BPEL,	Business	
Process Definition Metamodel and Web services for remote 
portlets, we also rated innovation as extremely important for long-
term differentiation. Finally, BPMS adoption is strongest in North 
America,	although	Europe,	Australia,	South	America	and	Central	
America are also growing, so we weighted geographic strategy as 
“standard” (see Table 2).

Leaders
Leaders offer products and services that best enable all of the 
use cases and have customer references for each. These vendors 
relentlessly focus on increasing the participation of business roles 
in process improvement efforts by enabling explicit, model-driven 
approaches, rather than traditional coding. Leaders’ products and 
services especially focus on business process analysts working 
alongside process owners to transform processes. They enable the 

highest	level	of	collaboration	among	business	and	IT	professionals,	
from the design and modeling phase through execution and 
optimization.	Except	for	IBM	and	Software	AG,	leaders	come	to	
this market with products that have evolved from BPM pure-play 
tools. (Tibco entered this market via its acquisition of Staffware’s 
BPM pure-play product several years ago.)

The leaders’ products support an iterative process improvement 
method in which the artifacts (outputs) of each phase move 
seamlessly into the next. Products from vendors with a BPM 
pure-play heritage (such as Pegasystems, Lombardi, Savvion and 
Metastorm) still come closest to delivering automated, model-
driven, round-trip behavior and thus the most fluid user experience. 
Because the model is visible and executable, processes can be 
flexible without sacrificing management control.

In	addition,	as	a	group,	leaders	exhibit	superior	sales	and	marketing	
execution. Many leaders exhibit strong innovation in their products, 
business models, and consulting and educational services. Many of 
these	vendors	have	introduced	new	SaaS	offerings	and	BPO	alliances,	
and are developing their partner ecosystems to support a BPP. We 
anticipate that these vendors will continue to be leaders through 2011, 
as interest in BPMS continues to grow, companies expand investments 
in continuous process improvement and formalize their BPP.

Metastorm	and	Global	360	are	the	only	Microsoft-centric	BPMS	
providers in the Leaders quadrant. Microsoft loyalists prioritize their 
requirements for BPM a bit differently than users that focus on Java 
Platform,	Enterprise	Edition	tools.	In	particular,	the	ability	to	integrate	
with	Microsoft	Office	SharePoint	Server	and	Microsoft	Office	is	
increasingly a key evaluation criterion. Furthermore, the difference in 
the underlying component model makes for varying implementation 
experiences. Unlike other Microsoft-centric BPMS providers in this 
Magic Quadrant, Metastorm’s strategy is to acquire technologies and 
services that broaden its offerings; enable it to sell beyond traditional, 
midmarket, Microsoft-loyalist enterprises; and compete more effectively 
in large, global enterprises.

Note 3
Customer Experience Criterion
In	this	criterion,	we	also	reflect	our	evaluation	of	the	overall	
users’ experience of the process improvement life cycle 
in a continuous improvement mentality. We considered 
products in terms of the experience of various roles, 
including authors and composers, developers, business 
process analysts, business process architects and even 
process participants.



9
In	May	2008,	Global	360	replaced	its	temporary	leadership	with	a	new	
team, which is shifting its strategy from growth by acquisition to organic 
growth. The updated strategy and product road map emphasize 
providing access to the right functions and the use of personas in the 
process improvement life cycle. The resulting user experience and 
interaction	model	is	unprecedented	among	.NET	BPMS	providers.

Challengers
The challengers are all strong companies that have undergone major 
changes in their organizations or products since our last Magic 
Quadrant. With these changes behind them, they are poised for growth. 
Fujitsu has recently reorganized its operations outside Japan to improve 
synergies among its hardware, software and service organizations. 
Oracle	acquired	BEA	and	adjusted	its	own	BPMS	product	road	map.	
(Acquisitions typically take a year to resolve the integration of people, 
products,	services	and	customers).	Oracle	has	begun	to	deliver	on	its	
plans to integrate the AquaLogic Business Process Management Suite 
(ALBPMS)	with	its	own	BPM	technologies.	EMC	had	to	integrate	the	
disparate	architectures	of	its	acquired	BPM	technologies.	Its	TaskSpace	
features	a	Web	2.0	UI	that	provides	integrated	access	to	many	(although	
not yet all) process artifacts and capabilities.

Fujitsu,	Oracle	and	EMC	offer	products	that	address	this	market	and	
contribute	to	their	vision	for	other	markets	too.	Fujitsu’s	and	Oracle’s	
BPMS	vision	reflects	BPM’s	adoption	of	SOA	and	service-oriented	
development	of	applications.	Oracle’s	vision	goes	further	to	embrace	
the BPP concept and service-oriented business applications. Thus, 
Oracle	and	Fujitsu	often	appear	on	buyers’	shortlists,	especially	when	
the	IT	organization	wants	to	establish	a	technology	standard	for	SOA-
enabled BPM. However, these vendors sometimes lose to a best-of-
breed market leader, especially when a business buyer is involved in 
the selection, and the organization highly values the paradigm shift 
mentioned previously.

EMC	approaches	this	market	primarily	by	cross-selling	and	
upselling	its	enterprise	content	management	(ECM)	and	EMC	Data	
Manager customers with its BPMS. With its heritage of a leading 
data	management	and	ECM	product,	EMC	has	developed	its	
BPMS to support case-management-style work (a complex style 
of	process)	better	than	many	others.	However,	EMC	references	are	
largely still doing document-centric workflow, rather than applying 
BPM disciplines to the above usage scenarios.

Products from vendors in the Challengers quadrant do not offer the 
same ease of use nor accessibility of functions for less-technical roles as 
those from the leaders. Generally, these products are weaker than those 
of the leaders for supporting continuous process improvement, and 
business	and	IT	user	collaboration	throughout	the	process	life	cycle.

Visionaries
In	general,	visionaries	are	innovators.	This	quadrant	has	changed	
the most from 2007. We included SAP and Sourcecode Technology 
Holdings (K2) this year, largely because of the high interest we see 
among our clients. Both bring a unique vision to this market. SAP’s 
NetWeaver BPM is the latest addition to the NetWeaver applications 
infrastructure	platform.	Like	Oracle,	SAPs	vision	encompasses	BPM	
and	SOA	in	support	of	a	BPP.	However,	SAP	also	recognizes	the	
need for resource coordination beyond business services and end-
to-end visibility for business professionals.

The	Sourcecode	(K2)	vision	recognizes	a	need	for	business	and	IT	
professionals to come together in new ways to succeed in BPM. 
Its	vision	reflects	the	wide	range	of	process	maturity	seen	in	the	
market, extending from enabling basic workflow through dynamic 
processes. K2’s Blackpearl is a major architectural advancement 
from its earlier product. Sourcecode (K2) has aggressively gained 
market share around the world by delivering deep integration; 
exploiting the growing popularity of Microsoft technologies, such as 
SharePoint	and	Office;	and	using	indirect	sales	channels.
Adobe’s visionary status comes from its focus on enriching 
customer experiences and enhancing collaboration in unstructured 
business processes. For processes that benefit from high-fidelity 
graphics and content presentation and manipulation, Adobe’s 
product is superior to others in this Magic Quadrant.

Singularity, Auraportal and Ascentn have executed well in 
2008 and expanded their market presence, while continuing to 
innovate. Singularity has the best approach for case management 
processes	among	the	.NET	providers.	Auraportal	has	introduced	
a number of innovative new features, such as Dynamic Activated 
Divisions, process dictionaries, active guests and secure 
rooms. Ascentn continues its focus on transforming traditional 
programming-intensive tasks into model-driven aspects for 
process composition. For example, it has extended Agileparts 
to data services, which enables business users to set up 
business activity monitoring (BAM), key performance indicators, 
reporting	and	analysis,	business	intelligence	(BI),	and	governance,	
regulatory and compliance functions as part of process modeling 
and	dramatically	reduces	IT	efforts.

Intalio,	the	only	open-source-based	BPMS	vendor	in	the	market,	
brings a unique business model to the BPMS market. By using 
open-source	technologies,	Intalio’s	business	model	is	less	capital-
intensive than the other small, private companies in this Magic 
Quadrant.	Furthermore,	Intalio	uses	the	open-source	community	
and Web-based technologies for marketing and promoting its 
products	and	concepts.	It	also	has	innovative	licensing	and	
pricing models (a commercial open-source license for an annual 
subscription).	In	the	current	economy,	Intalio	is	enjoying	increased	
interest in its business model.

Cordys is also new to our Magic Quadrant. Well-known thought 
leader Jon Pyke (founder of Staffware and of the Workflow 
Management Coalition) joined Cordys in 2007 and seeks to 
differentiate	Cordys	by	the	concept	of	the	Business	Operations	
Platform. Cordys has some unique features in its product, such 
as organizational models, business calendars, repository views 
and	access,	and	support	for	master	data	management	(MDM).	In	
addition, Cordys has launched The Process Factory, a multitenant 
SaaS offering.

Niche Players
Polymita entered the Magic Quadrant this year. A small BPMS 
provider	with	strong	reference	customers	in	Europe	(mostly	Spain),	
Polymita has recently expanded its presence in Latin America. 
Polymita’s innovative ideas include providing MDM capabilities to 
enable dynamic data modeling and rapid implementations.



10
In	our	2007	Magic	Quadrant,	Ultimus	had	just	introduced	v.8,	a	
major architectural advancement. The timing of that release put 
Ultimus into the Visionary quadrant at that time. Since then, the 
company’s new leadership has shifted focus from the product to 
improving operations and aligning all of its capabilities, such as 
training and professional services, behind the vision for v.8. As a 
result, Ultimus has new, online interactive training, new marketing 
messages and positioning, new pricing models, some internal 
restructuring and renewed focus on the U.S. market. Meanwhile, 
however, the market has not stood still. Thus, Ultimus moved to the 
Niche	Players	quadrant	this	year.	Its	product	is	largely	sold	through	
system integrators or as part of a consulting engagement. Most 
customers use it mainly for human workflow (Ultimus’s heritage) 
or rely on solution partners to custom build a solution. Thus, for 
this analysis, we found that v.8 is not yet field-proven for the more 
advanced use cases.

Vendor Strengths and Cautions

Adobe Systems
This	analysis	pertains	to	Adobe	Livecycle	ES	v.8.2.
Strengths

•	 The	product	is	highly	appealing,	with	visually	rich	integration	
of	documents,	rich	Internet	applications	(RIAs),	unstructured	
content in the context of a business process, and rule-based 
customized security and personalization.

•	 Adobe	has	a	clear,	distinct	vision	to	provide	tools	and	services	
to manage transparent, agile processes that deliver engaging 
customer experiences.

•	 Customer	reference	checks	indicate	that	Adobe	has	significantly	
strengthened its enterprise support services during the past 12 
to 18 months.

•	 UI	designers	are	able	to	author	a	UI	only	once,	capture	it	as	an	
XML document, and have it automatically rendered in a variety 
of	formats	(PDF,	RIA	and	HTML).

•	 Livecycle	ES	integration	with	Adobe	AIR	and	the	use	of	PDF	
enables process participants to work online or offline.

Cautions

•	 Although	Adobe	has	strengthened	its	focus	on	its	enterprise	
business and on the Livecycle product family, market 
awareness of Adobe as a BPMS vendor remains low.

•	 Given	Adobe’s	presence	in	the	forms	market,	customers	often	
view	LiveCycle	ES	as	a	good	product	for	forms-based	workflow	
and do not pursue continuous process improvement initiatives.

•	 Although	members	of	the	Adobe	Enterprise	Developer	program	
can build and test business processes using Adobe Livecycle 
ES	Developer	Express	cloud	capabilities,	Adobe	does	not	yet	
offer	a	runtime	version	of	Adobe	LiveCycle	ES	in	the	cloud.

•	 Customers	looking	to	deploy	Adobe	LiveCycle	ES	in	internal	
IT	shared	service	centers,	and	partners	looking	for	a	SaaS	
platform	provider,	should	be	aware	that	Adobe	LiveCycle	ES	
does not support a full multitenant architecture.

Appian
These	comments	refer	to	Appian	Enterprise	v.5.7.
Strengths

•	 Appian	Enterprise	5.7	is	one	of	the	most	user-friendly	products	
in this market and enables business users to take control of 
almost every aspect of a BPMS offering.

•	 Appian	Enterprise	is	one	of	few	BPM	products	that	provides	
a	100%	thin-client	architecture	for	design	time	and	runtime.	
Its	tightly	integrated	environment	provides	a	seamless	user	
experience for each component. With this unique architecture, 
Appian has a complete BPM SaaS offering, Appian Anywhere.

•	 Appian	has	identified	the	strength	of	a	repository-based	
enterprise	architecture	(EA)	tool	beyond	the	simple	transfer	of	
process models, and, therefore, it has embarked on a deep 
relationship	with	MEGA,	one	of	the	leaders	in	the	business	
process analysis (BPA) market.

Cautions

•	 Appian’s	aggressive	growth	strategy	–	leading	this	year	to	a	
300%	increase	in	Europe,	the	Middle	East	and	Africa	–	will	put	
pressure on the organization to deliver on this strategy, and 
could result in some locations having limited partner support.

•	 Although	it	is	one	of	the	first	vendors	to	offer	a	BPMS	through	
SaaS, few customers have adopted this approach.

Ascentn
This analysis pertains to AgilePoint BPMS 4.5.
Strengths

•	 Ascentn	AgilePoint	is	a	true	model-driven,	.NET	BPMS	and	a	
metadata-driven,	IT-asset-abstraction	framework.	It	enables	the	
support of dynamic processes throughout the entire Microsoft 
software stack, including BizTalk Server, SharePoint Server, 
Windows	Workflow	Foundation,	Microsoft	Office	and	Visual	
Studio.	The	metadata-driven,	IT	asset-abstraction	framework	
can be used to process-enable system activities into AgileParts 
and dynamic human activities called AgileWorks. Agile Parts 
and AgileWorks can be assembled and configured at the 
process layer to create directly executable processes.

•	 AgilePoint’s	modeler	is	Visio;	it	is	the	actual	.NET	composition	
environment, not simply BPMN stencils that are converted. This 
approach builds on the business user’s experience and comfort 
with this tool.

•	 Ascentn	is	a	preferred	partner	in	the	Microsoft	Business	
Process Alliance program, which entitles Ascentn to direct 
Microsoft	R&D,	marketing	and	sales	support.	Its	close	
relationship is contributing to significant product growth.

•	 The	architecture	is	open	and	clean.	The	relationship	with	
Microsoft means that new technologies from Microsoft are 
easily	exploited	and	integrated	(such	as	the	WCF	and	.NET	
frameworks). The architecture contributes to a highly productive 
development experience.

•	 Customer	references	demonstrate	an	unusual	level	of	BPM	
sophistication for Microsoft-centric enterprises; they use Ascentn 
with mission-critical processes and broad deployments.



11
Cautions

•	 As	a	small	company,	Ascentn	concentrates	its	resources	on	
core product functions. Functions beyond core capabilities, 
such as governance over process assets and simulation 
and optimization, are weak. Customers may also need to 
supplement AgilePoint with a third-party rule engine.

•	 Ascentn	has	a	small	Professional	Service	team;	it	relies	more	
on service providers for solution delivery, consulting and BPM 
transformation services.

•	 Ascentn	has	not	yet	developed	an	ecosystem	of	partners,	nor	a	
community of users to foster the creation of reusable business 
service content based on AgilePoint.

AuraPortal
These	comments	pertain	to	AuraPortal	BPMS	v.3.1.
Strengths

•	 AuraPortal	keeps	delivering	an	example	of	next-generation	
BPMS. The company understands that BPMS products need to 
be oriented toward business users.

•	 In	its	newest	release,	AuraPortal	has	introduced	innovative	
functions, such as Dynamically Activated Divisions, that support 
the combination of runtime creation and control of tasks, case-
handling features and ad hoc task management.

•	 AuraPortal	BPMS	features	model-driven	execution	(models	
can be executed immediately, without the need to program 
any code) based on a process dictionary, and is completely 
Web-based.

Cautions

•	 AuraPortal	is	preparing	to	enter	new	geographies	(North	
America	and	Eastern	Europe)	and	will	have	to	execute	a	strong	
partner strategy.

•	 An	increase	of	130%	in	its	customer	base	requires	a	strong	
management strategy and a bigger, more-experienced 
management team.

•	 Most	of	the	reference	cases	are	Spanish-speaking	customers	
(in Spain and Latin America); we expect some changes in 2009, 
if the vendor can deliver on its growth strategy.

Cordys
This	analysis	pertains	to	Cordys	Business	Operations	Platform	v.4.
Strengths

•	 Cordys	has	a	strong	product,	despite	its	being	new,	with	a	
modular architecture and some unique features: organization 
models, business calendars, repository views and access, and 
support for MDM.

•	 The	Process	Factory	is	a	hosted,	multitenancy,	SaaS	offering	
targeting small and midsize businesses and Web developers 
that want to develop simpler workflows, rather than full process 
management systems. Cordys relies on partners to host it.

•	 Cordys	has	strong	market	understanding	and	product	vision	
for a business-oriented, operational platform for managing 
processes in real time.

Cautions

•	 As	a	new	competitor	in	this	market,	Cordys	has	few	references	
using	its	complete	BPMS	and	few	customers	outside	of	Europe.

•	 UIs	throughout	the	product	are	functional,	but	basic	in	look	and	
feel; they affect intuitiveness and ease of use, especially for less-
technical	roles.	Generated	UIs	are	also	average	in	look	and	feel.

•	 Cordys	must	attract	independent	software	vendors	(ISVs)	to	the	
platform.

EMC
This	analysis	pertains	to	EMC	BPMS	v.6.5	Service	Pack	1.
Strengths

•	 EMC	has	done	a	good	job	integrating	the	pieces	of	its	
BPMS	via	Taskspace,	a	Web	2.0	UI	that	enables	business	
professionals to more easily manage dynamic processes.

•	 EMC	is	one	of	the	few	BPMSs	that	supports	case-
management-style processes well.

•	 EMC	has	many	system	integrators	and	consulting	firms	as	partners.

Cautions

•	 In	a	crowded	market,	awareness	of	EMC	as	a	BPMS	
competitor is low, relative to others in this Magic Quadrant.

•	 References	with	which	we	spoke	did	not	use	all	of	EMC’s	
BPMS	components	to	support	BPM	initiatives.	Many	EMC	
customers	exploit	EMC’s	BPMS	as	a	document	workflow	
technology, rather than exploiting its full BPMS functions.

•	 Some	of	EMC’s	sales	force	and	partners	are	less	trained	
on	best	practices	for	implementing	BPM	than	on	ECM	
and workflow. Buyers need to be clear about their needs 
and assess consultants for BPM methodology and BPMS 
implementation experience.

•	 Support	for	the	process	improvement	life	cycle	is	not	seamless,	
which affects collaboration between roles. For example, 
modelers and developers use different tools and, thus, do 
not work on the same copy of the model simultaneously. 
They “share” a process model by creating new versions each 
time it is checked out of the repository. The environment 
then automatically reconciles the copies. Similarly, there is no 
graphical, step-through mode for business roles to experience 
a prototype of the solution; rather, there is a graphical debugger 
appropriate for technical roles. Taskspace is addressing these 
issues by providing a composite solution perspective and 
access to runtime artifacts.



12
Fujitsu
This	analysis	pertains	to	Fujitsu	Interstage	BPM	10.0.
Strengths

•	 The	vendor’s	Automated	Process	Discovery	(APD)	Services	
program helps clients identify critical process paths across 
established systems and helps pinpoint where to start with new 
BPM projects.

•	 Fujitsu	has	recently	undertaken	a	global	restructuring.	The	new	
reorganization is producing more synergies between Fujitsu 
software and service organizations across regions, and provides 
a more unified engagement experience for multinational 
customers.

•	 Fujitsu	is	ramping	up	its	BPM	practice	in	its	professional	service	
organizations.

•	 Fujitsu	Interstage	BPM	is	a	multitenant	SaaS	platform	that	can	
be used for private cloud services or as a platform for external 
SaaS or cloud offerings.

•	 Fujitsu	Interstage	BPM	provides	solid	support	for	BPM	roles	
across the business process life cycle and a scalable software 
infrastructure and composition environment for organizations 
looking	to	move	to	SOA.

Cautions

•	 APD	is	a	consulting	service,	rather	than	a	product.	Fujitsu	will	
introduce APD as a product in June 2009.

•	 Fujitsu	Interstage	BPMS	implementations	have	typically	been	
led	by	IT	professionals,	and	projects	initially	focus	on	process	
integration and later evolve to address continuous process 
improvement.

•	 Fujitsu	continues	to	expand	its	Interstage	BPMS	alliances	with	
larger consultants and system integrators. Customers may find 
it	difficult	to	obtain	Interstage	BPMS	expertise	from	midtier	or	
boutique consultancies that do smaller, bottom-up BPM projects.

Global 360
This	analysis	pertains	to	Process360	v.9.5.1,	with	Insight360	v.2.1.0.
Strengths

•	 A	common-process	metamodel	is	shared	across	Global	360’s	
simple, business-oriented process modeling and its technical-
modeling environment. This metamodel enables full round-
tripping, although it is manual.

•	 With	Insight360,	Global	360	extends	optimization	to	the	
problem	of	broader	workforce	optimization.	External	application	
events and data may be captured via a service interface, 
imported through an XLS or CSV file, or extracted from a 
database,	and	loaded	into	Insight’s	cubes.	The	cubes	can	
be mined to understand the implied process and the process 
performance metrics. The system can make recommendations 
for optimization of resources.

•	 Global	360	is	one	of	the	few	vendors	whose	BPMS	supports	
case-management-style processes well.

•	 The	new	vision	and	strategy	for	enhancing	business	
professionals’ experience throughout the process life cycle is 
strong,	well-researched	and	innovative.	It	will	be	productized	in	
later 2009.

•	 Legacy	business	in	EDM	and	ECM,	and	a	buyout	two	years	
ago,	means	Global	360	is	financially	stronger	than	many	other	
BPMS vendors.

Cautions

•	 Global	360’s	process	intelligence,	case	management	and	
process optimization requires a higher level of process 
management maturity than is typical of the Microsoft buyer. 
Most small and midsize BPMS buyers are looking for graphical-
workflow modeling and execution, rather than sophisticated 
process analysis or optimization.

•	 Collaboration	across	business	and	IT	roles	in	the	life	cycle	
is weak. For example, models are passed back and forth, 
because of different modelers for different roles, and 
Insight360’s	repository	is	separate	from	Process360.

•	 Underlying	technologies	do	not	have	a	uniform	architecture.	Parts	
of it are proprietary and, in places, legacy technology. This lack 
of uniformity contributes to a suboptimal BPM experience. Global 
360’s	plans	to	unify	and	advance	the	technologies	will	require	
customers to keep up with interim steps to gain the benefits.

IBM
This	analysis	is	based	on	IBM	BPMS	v.6.1.2.	The	two	foundational	
offerings under this moniker are the WebSphere Dynamic Process 
Edition	and	the	FileNet	Active	Content	Edition.	We	considered	the	
combined functionality.
Strengths

•	 IBM	has	marshaled	all	its	resources	–	including	Global	Services,	
university outreach, industry expertise and its partner ecosystem 
– to accelerate user adoption of BPM as a management 
discipline.

•	 IBM’s	Smarter	SOA	campaign	benefits	its	BPMS	by	showing	
how	SOA	and	BPM	work	better	together.

•	 IBM’s	broad	and	strong	technologies	enable	BPM	to	help	users	
advance	their	SOAs	and	evolve	toward	a	BPP	model.

•	 IBM	has	a	vision	for	exposing	process	artifacts	and	data	more	
directly	to	business	professionals.	Its	role-based	business	space	
UIs	expose	configurable	widgets	to	directly	manipulate	lower-
level assets.

•	 IBM	has	built	an	impressive	software	and	IT	service	ecosystem	
for	its	SOA	Foundation	and	has	established	notable	market	
awareness	of	its	SOA	and	BPM	capabilities.

Cautions

•	 IBM	doesn’t	have	one	BPMS	product;	rather,	it	fulfills	its	BPM	
strategy through federated interoperability across two basic 
offerings	augmented	by	extended	offerings.	IBM	has	made	
significant progress with integration across the two basic 
offerings, but has not yet achieved full integration.

•	 The	broader	software	division’s	acquisition	strategy	will	
continue	to	augment	IBM’s	BPMS	vision	and	product	road	
map. Customers will need to monitor the integration of new 
technologies.



13
•	 Individual	products	in	the	suite	have	strong	and	rich	

functionality. However, in combination, the permutations of 
configuration possibilities are overwhelming. Customers usually 
require help from a service provider.

•	 WebSphere	Dynamic	BPMS	edition	has	few	references.

Intalio
These	comments	pertain	to	Intalio	Enterprise	Edition	v.5.2.1.
Strengths

•	 In	the	current	harsh	economic	climate,	open	source	is	gaining	
more	attention.	Intalio	has	a	unique	business	model	that	uses	
open-source content, licensing and community marketing.

•	 The	intelligent	use	of	an	open-source	business	model,	
combined with the adoption of industry standards, has resulted 
in	more	than	50,000	companies	downloading	Intalio	BPMS	
Community	Edition.

•	 Tight	integration	with	other	open-source	vendors	such	as	
Alfresco (content management) and recent acquisitions extend 
the	reach	of	Intalio	in	this	market.

Cautions

•	 Advanced	features	for	business	rule	engines,	BAM	and	ECM	
are	only	available	in	the	commercial	Enterprise	Edition.

•	 Companies	that	start	using	Intalio	Community	Edition	should	
be	prepared	to	invest	in	training,	because	Intalio	does	not	offer	
consulting services, and consulting alliance partners are more 
focused	on	services	involving	the	Commercial	Edition.

•	 Commercial,	next-generation	products	that	are	easier	and	
faster to implement are entering the BPMS market. Thus, the 
advantage of starting with a free, limited version to discover the 
use of functions and features is rapidly diminishing.

K2
These comments pertain to K2 Blackpearl.
Strengths

•	 K2	Blackpearl	is	built	100%	on	the	Windows	Workflow	
Foundation	framework	and	delivers	deep	integration	with	Office	
Communication Server.

•	 Sourcecode	(K2)’s	product	unit	strategy	enables	customers	to	
supplement their Microsoft technology and skill investments 
with a low-cost workflow technology, incrementally advance 
their BPM maturity and exploit the full capabilities of Blackpearl.

•	 This	company	understands	the	Microsoft	developer	mentality	
and priorities. K2 Blackpearl’s authoring environments keep 
things easy (such as Smartobjects for integrating and reusing 
external data and Visio drawing migration); they are role-based 
and graphical.

•	 The	Sourcecode	(K2)	ecosystem	of	more	than	200	partners	
and 6,000 K2 Underground members provide a significant 
community of K2 Blackpearl expertise and knowledge sharing.

•	 Blackpearl	comes	with	many	process	pattern	templates	for	
coordinating	popular	workflows	across	Microsoft	Office,	
SharePoint,	Infopath,	SQL	Server,	SAP	and	Microsoft	CRM.

Cautions

•	 Sourcecode	(K2)’s	product	development	strategy	purposely	
reflects its dependency on Microsoft technologies, rather than 
development of their own, comparable capabilities in certain areas. 
The newness of this version of K2 Blackpearl combined with 
Sourcecode (K2)’s development strategy means that some buyers 
will find K2 Blackpearl somewhat lacking in features as a complete 
BPMS.	In	particular,	buyers	with	demanding	needs	in	such	areas	
as dashboards, simulation, optimization and rules should consider 
Sourcecode (K2) partners that specialize in these areas.

•	 Few	references	with	whom	we	spoke	yet	use	K2	Blackpearl	
for sophisticated, cross-functional BPM projects with a large 
scope and scale. The largest percentage of implementations 
with which we have spoken over the past year are midsize 
enterprises	doing	content	workflow	with	SharePoint	and	Office.

•	 K2	Blackpearl	enables	rapid	modeling,	assembly	and	
management of business-process-based applications. At 
this	point,	this	product	supports	IT	roles	better	than	business	
roles.	Its	authoring	tools	and	resulting	process	solutions	
are predominantly supported by Microsoft developers (not 
process analysts and architects), who view K2 Blackpearl as a 
simpler, more-productive approach to exploiting core Microsoft 
infrastructure technologies.

Lombardi Software
This analysis pertains to Lombardi Teamworks 6.2.
Strengths

•	 Lombardi	has	keen	insights	into	the	functions	required	by	each	
user role involved in the business process life cycle. Lombardi 
consistently produces highly intuitive software that addresses 
each role’s perspective, while providing an integrated round-trip 
user experience.

•	 Because	Teamworks	is	easy	for	business	analysts	to	use,	it	
is well-suited to continuous process improvement programs 
where empowering business users or business analysts is key.

•	 The	business	process	executes	from	the	process	model,	
thereby simplifying dynamic changes to in-flight business 
processes at runtime and preventing design-time artifacts from 
getting out-of-sync with implementation artifacts.

•	 Lombardi	customer	references	are	among	the	most	advanced	
in BPM maturity. They demonstrate broad adoption of BPM 
across an organization that yield transformative business 
results.

•	 Blueprint	appeals	to	business	managers	and	strategic	planners	
who seek a tool for high-level process diagramming and 
knowledge	capture.	It	complements	the	Teamworks	process	
models and is available via low-cost SaaS.

Cautions

•	 Customers	with	smaller	deal	sizes	may	find	it	challenging	to	
command Lombardi’s attention.

•	 Lombardi’s	support	for	case	management	processes	is	not	as	
strong as some of its competitors.



14
•	 Lombardi	Teamworks	does	not	offer	multitenant	SaaS,	which	
some	ISVs	may	need	for	highly	scalable	cloud	services	or	
enterprises may want for private cloud services.

•	 Lombardi	does	not	invest	in	process	templates	or	frameworks	
or recruit partners to build solution accelerators. These factors 
may be an obstacle for organizations looking for specific 
process-based applications.

Metastorm
This analysis pertains to Metastorm BPM v.7.6.
Strengths

•	 Customer	experiences	in	2008	have	been	excellent.

•	 Ease	of	use	of	the	product	by	nontechnical	people	is	strong.

•	 Metastorm	has	a	strong	heritage	in	providing	BPM	software	
based on Microsoft technologies and is a leading Microsoft 
Business Process Alliance partner.

•	 Metastorm’s	go-to-market	strategy	is	to	offer	best-of-breed	
EA,	business	process	architecture,	and	BPM	technology	that	
can be implemented as stand-alone solutions or integrated 
components. With these three pillars of technology, the 
company aims to help organizations unify or link strategies, 
analyses and process executions.

Cautions

•	 Metastorm	has	combined	software	for	EA,	BPA	and	BPM,	and	
many customers license Metastorm’s software or make buying 
decisions based on this broader offering. Nevertheless, most 
customers have not yet engaged in single projects that span 
all areas. Consequently, Metastorm will need to continue to 
develop integration and reuse that encourages customers to 
accelerate implementation of the full platform.

•	 Some	users	have	reported	support	problems	outside	the	U.S.	
Metastorm has developed a global presence through regional 
resellers to sell its BPMS and targeted solutions. Users should 
understand the scope of the solutions they buy from a reseller and 
the path to further licensing options to ensure expectations are met.

•	 Some	customers	report	difficulties	in	negotiating	pricing	and	
contracts.	It	may	take	longer	than	anticipated	to	determine	the	
appropriate licensing configuration.

Oracle
This	analysis	pertains	to	Oracle	BPM	Suite	10gR3.
Strengths

•	 The	center	of	Oracle’s	BPM	Suite	10gR3	is	BEA’s	ALBPMS	
v.6.1. The business analyst experience and round-tripping 
within	the	ALBPM	elements	(now	called	Oracle	BPM)	of	the	
product are solid.

•	 Oracle	BPM	Suite	10gR3	includes	BEA	ALBPMS	and	additional	
BEA	and	Oracle	components,	but	costs	less	than	BEA	ALBPMS.

•	 At	some	point,	Oracle	plans	to	enable	business	analysts	to	
monitor and change process flows in application integration 
architecture	applications	via	Oracle	BPM	Suite.

Cautions

•	 Oracle	BPM	Suite	10gR3	has	multiple,	redundant,	loosely	
integrated design time and runtime tools. Thus, customers 
that	use	the	non-BEA	components	in	10gR3	will	find	that	the	
discipline of BPM is not easily enforceable across the process 
life cycle; executables can be changed independently of the 
model, thus breaking round-trip synchronization. This gap 
places more of the burden of process governance on the user 
via manual procedures and policies.

•	 Oracle	BPM	Suite	10gR3	contains	few	additional	functions	for	
BEA	ALBPM	users.	Although	Oracle	BPM	Suite	11g	is	intended	
to	provide	additional,	more-unified	capabilities,	BEA	ALBPM	
users	will	need	to	upgrade	to	10gR3	first,	then	move	to11g.

•	 The	transition	from	Oracle	BPM	Suite	10gR3	to	11g	is	a	major	
product revision. Customers should be aware that this may 
involve the migration of some solution assets and is not just a 
straightforward upgrade.

Pegasystems
This analysis is based on PRPC v.5.5.
Strengths

•	 Pegasystems’	primary	strength	remains	its	unified	object	
architecture that structures all process artifacts, including 
processes,	policies	and	UIs.	This	architecture	enables	
Pegasystems to deliver a declarative modeling composition 
environment that improves the ability of the BPMS to change 
and adapt to new business needs.

•	 Pegasystems’	SmartBPM	Suite’s	new	capabilities	support	
agility, including using the BPM system itself to capture 
business objectives, accelerate deployment, manage projects, 
automate testing, provide self-tuning optimization and improve 
integration directly into clients’ Web environments.

•	 In	2008,	the	company	introduced	a	cloud-enabled	“platform	
as a service” to help organizations set up centers of excellence 
and ease adoption of BPM initiatives across departments, 
subsidiaries, lines of business, outsourced work units and 
trading partners.

•	 Pegasystems	has	significant	experience	running	federated	BPM	
systems at its large clients and has aggressively added capabilities 
for disparate organizations to scale and federate their BPM 
implementations. These capabilities include a new, enterprisewide 
BPM registry and repository, and tools to coordinate BPM 
projects	across	the	enterprise,	export	to	industry-standard	BI	data	
warehouses and optimize multinode systems.

•	 The	company	continues	to	add	to	its	library	of	prebuilt,	industry-
specific frameworks for composite applications, which give 
customers a base layer, including common industry standards 
and	best	practices.	It	also	reports	a	doubling	of	its	customer	
service business based on its CRM framework and facilities for 
automating multichannel services.

Cautions

•	 Pegasystems	does	not	yet	have	an	OEM	or	value-added	
reseller (VAR) channel and largely relies on direct sales and 
strategic consulting partners.



15
•	 Pegasystems’	declarative	composition	environment	is	new	to	

most users, which will require help learning to take advantage 
of it. Customers that do not follow the methodology of iterative 
development and business user engagement will lose out on 
the benefits these new approaches can bring.

•	 The	vendor’s	sales	presence	is	biased	toward	North	America	
and	Europe	and	has	not	focused	on	growing	its	presence	in	
the	Asia/Pacific	region	or	South	America;	thus,	it	is	missing	
opportunities to grow globally.

Polymita Technologies
This analysis pertains to Polymita Business Suite v.4.0.
Strengths

•	 Polymita	is	a	Spanish	vendor	that	features	model-driven	
development with a strong emphasis on MDM to create a single 
view of data and processes. This approach enables business 
users to make changes to processes and master data on 
running processes.

•	 Polymita	shows	the	shortest	implementation	times	in	the	
BPMS market.

•	 Polymita	has	one	of	the	strongest	support	capabilities	for	
case management as a BPMS use case among the Java-
based offerings.

Cautions

•	 As	a	small	vendor	in	a	tough	global	economy,	Polymita	will	be	
significantly challenged to gain global market share.

•	 As	a	small	company,	Polymita	will	go	through	organizational	
challenges	to	deliver	on	its	growth	strategy.	International	growth	
will be its primary challenge in 2009.

•	 Polymita	has	a	small	installed	base,	and	its	references	are	
predominantly in Spanish and Latin American organizations.

Savvion
This analysis reflects Savvion BusinessManager 7.5.
Strengths

•	 Savvion	BusinessManager	7.5	is	one	of	the	most-mature	BPMS	
products.	Its	ability	to	handle	high-volume	workflows,	requiring	
tight coordination of people and systems, has contributed to 
Savvion’s	growing	success	in	the	BPO	market,	in	addition	to	
direct sales to enterprises.

•	 This	product	has	an	open,	multitiered,	service-oriented	and	
standards-based architecture, with well-documented application 
programming interfaces. Thus, it is easy to integrate with 
software infrastructures and application development tools, as 
well as to embed for partners.

•	 Visualization	of	many	process	aspects	is	innovative	and	easy	to	
use	for	business	professionals.	Examples	include	its	modeler,	
design time repository, dashboards and reports, and a new 
graphic for analysis of process execution paths.

•	 Business	Expert	supports	real-time	analysis	of	in-flight	
processes and dynamically suggests changes to process 

conditions	and	rules	to	keep	running	processes	optimal.	It	has	
strong reporting capabilities. Users can dynamically add new 
process performance metrics in the runtime environment to gain 
insight into current execution data.

Cautions

•	 Savvion’s	current	release	reflects	the	tactical	needs	of	a	
few of its best customers more than its own, market-driven 
innovations. Two examples (which we find inconsistent with 
the requirements of this market) are a new tabular method of 
data entry for process activities and new support for project 
management (which is somewhat competitive with Microsoft 
Project). Customers should watch for developments that evolve 
in directions inconsistent with mainstream market demand.

•	 Beyond	the	U.S.,	Savvion	serves	its	customers	primarily	through	
indirect sales channels, partners and resellers. (Savvion has a 
small	direct	presence	in	Europe	and	a	larger	direct	and	indirect	
presence	in	India.)

•	 As	Savvion	expands	its	sales	through	more	indirect	channels,	
such as system integrators and consulting partners, business 
process	outsourcers,	and	OEM	relationships,	enterprises	should	
watch for any impact to support and product release plans from 
resources being spread too thin.

SAP
This analysis pertains to SAP NetWeaver BPM and SAP 
NetWeaver BRM, which are part of SAP’s NetWeaver Composition 
Environment	7.1	Enhancement	Package	1.
Strengths

•	 Excellent	integration	with	SAP’s	Enterprise	services	repository	
makes it easy to exploit services and create before, after and 
between workflows.

•	 NetWeaver	BPM	enables	process	experts	to	work	directly	
with business leaders to extend SAP applications with explicit 
workflows that cross SAP and non-SAP applications.

•	 Scenario	models	provide	high-level,	contextual	business	views	
to complement BPMN process flow models.

•	 Integration	with	NetWeaver	CE	provides	one	environment	to	
support the new, composition-driven life cycle (including the 
process	layer,	UI	layer,	service	layer	and	rules).	This	setup	supports	
collaboration across multiple roles throughout the life cycle.

Cautions

•	 SAP	has	focused	on	core	BPM	capabilities	for	its	initial	release.	
Clients will find its features to be weak in some areas (such as 
reporting	and	dashboards,	group	collaboration,	UI	support	and	
content integration), compared with best-of-breed products. 
(However its integration with SAP NetWeaver Business Rules is 
stronger than that of many other vendors.)

•	 Only	WebDynpro	clients	are	supported	initially,	and	only	online	
Adobe forms are integrated in WebDynpro. SAP will deliver 
Visual Composer integration in 2009.



16
•	 The	initial	release	doesn’t	support	business	roles	as	effectively	
as	it	supports	developer	roles	(because	of	its	focus	on	Eclipse,	
BPMN and graphical debug).

•	 As	with	other	NetWeaver	components,	the	bigger	the	
customer’s	commitment	to	SAP,	the	more	attractive	this	tool.	It	
will always work better with SAP assets than non-SAP assets.

Singularity
These	comments	pertain	to	Singularity	Process	Platform	v.3.7.
Strengths

•	 Long	experience	in	the	process	management	world	has	given	
this U.K. player a sound understanding of the BPMS market 
and led Singularity to progressive ideas in this market.

•	 Singularity	offers	complete	functions,	but	differs	from	other	
vendors through its strong focus on knowledge-centric process 
support. This focus has resulted in the most-complete solution 
for case management in the BPMS market – for example, 
support for case modeling, case relationships and predictive 
analysis on cases.

•	 Singularity’s	business	model	is	strong;	the	company	supports	
partners in telecommunications, capital markets and 
government, as well as a generic BPM channel complemented 
by the market-specific Process Accelerators.

•	 Singularity	offers	a	unique	implementation	method	involving	
different teams at the customer site that compete within the 
organization for the best solution.

Cautions

•	 Knowledge	worker	processes	and	case	management	require	
special skills and an appropriate approach to implementing the 
product’s advanced features. These skills are not widespread in 
the market.

•	 Singularity	is	expanding	into	several	other	global	regions	and	
has grown its staff from 190 to 240 people. Managing and 
supporting the growth model set forward will be its biggest 
challenge in 2009.

Software AG
This analysis pertains to Software AG’s webMethods BPMS 7.1.1.
Strengths

•	 Software	AG	has	a	clear	opportunity	with	CentraSite	to	tie	
the business service repository to its BPM strategy to change 
BPMS into a governance mission.

•	 A	broad	breadth	of	technology	and	a	loyal	customer	base	provide	
a community in which new BPMS features can be deployed while 
experimenting with more-radical cloud-based options.

•	 The	webMethods	BPMS	offers	an	integrated	business	user	
experience, balanced support for multiple interaction types, 
and	well-integrated,	attractive	simulation	capabilities.	It	also	
provides	SOA	governance	through	a	Universal	Description,	
Discovery	and	Integration	federation	service	link	to	
CentraSite	Governance	Edition.

Cautions

•	 Software	AG	lacks	a	well-developed	ecosystem	for	IT	service	
and application developments partner around industry-specific 
BPM solutions or templates.

•	 The	company	has	had	difficulty	articulating	its	value	proposition	
and industry-specific, go-to-market strategy for BPM. The 
company needs a clear-cut, efficient strategy to compete with 
larger	BPM	vendors,	such	as	Oracle	and	IBM.

•	 The	UI	Designer	is	not	appropriate	for	business	analysts.	
Rather,	UI	design	remains	largely	a	programmer	responsibility.	
The product supports JSR168 portlets, JavaServer faces and 
Ajax	only	as	UI	styles.

Tibco Software
This analysis pertains to Tibco iProcess v.11.
Strengths

•	 iProcess	Suite	uses	an	event-driven	architecture,	with	a	strong,	
wizard-driven BAM layer to enable deep process insight.

•	 There	is	good	support	for	many	open	standards,	including	
XSLT,	XPDL,	BPEL	and	BPMN.	Artifacts	are	saved	as	XPDL	
and	enable	easier	translation	from	BPMN	to	runtime	BPEL	and	
interoperability	with	other	BPM	tools,	such	as	IDS	Scheer.

•	 Tibco	has	a	strong	vision	of	“Dynamic	BPM”	as	products	
move forward.

Cautions

•	 A	sophisticated	product	and	high	price	prevent	Tibco	from	
appealing to less-mature buyers and smaller organizations.

•	 The	company	is	continually	mentioned	as	a	buyout	candidate,	
with few legitimate buyers left. However, acquisition poses 
a minor risk, because this rumor has been around for years 
without	action.	Even	in	the	case	of	an	acquisition,	the	
technology stack is likely to remain intact.

•	 There	is	little	support	for	complex	content	interactions,	such	as	
case-management-style workflows.



17
Ultimus
This analysis pertains to Ultimus Adaptive BPMS v.8.1.
Strengths

•	 Ultimus	BPM	Suite	8.1	offers	particularly	strong	human-
workflow technology that is conducive to change and 
decreasing time to deployment, as well as a work management 
platform that can readily handle exceptions.

•	 Ultimus	has	expanded	its	human-interaction	capabilities	with	a	
“Human Services Bus” – an advanced way of parallel working 
on	process	instances	from	different	flows.	It	has	been	built	on	
its	3-D	XML	data	storage	concept.

•	 BPM	Suite	8.1	has	been	localized	into	16	languages,	sold	
directly in 16 countries and offered in 80 other countries 
through partners and VARs.

•	 Ultimus	has	gradually	developed	a	flexible	pricing	model	that	
starts with pricing by process and is later tailored to actual user 
licenses in a tiered model.

Cautions

•	 In	2008,	we	saw	implementations	focused	primarily	on	
departmental	solutions	on	top	of	ERP	solutions	or	routing	
of forms for human approvals and reviews. Most of these 
implementations are workflow-like, rather than reflecting BPM 
disciplines and methods.

•	 In	2009,	Ultimus	will	launch	a	“lite”	version	of	its	Adaptive	BPMS	
Suite, which will focus explicitly on workflow, and will reinforce 
its reputation as a pure workflow vendor.

Vendors Added or Dropped
We review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants and 
MarketScopes as markets change. As a result of these adjustments, 
the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant or MarketScope may 
change over time. A vendor appearing in a Magic Quadrant or 
MarketScope one year and not the next does not necessarily 
indicate that we have changed our opinion of that vendor. This may 
be a reflection of a change in the market and, therefore, changed 
evaluation criteria, or a change of focus by a vendor.

Evaluation Criteria Definitions

Ability to Execute
Product/Service:	Core	goods	and	services	offered	by	the	vendor	that	compete	in/serve	the	defined	market.	This	includes	current	
product/service	capabilities,	quality,	feature	sets	and	skills,	whether	offered	natively	or	through	OEM	agreements/partnerships	as	
defined in the market definition and detailed in the subcriteria.

Overall Viability (Business Unit, Financial, Strategy, Organization): Viability includes an assessment of the overall organization’s 
financial health, the financial and practical success of the business unit, and the likelihood that the individual business unit will 
continue investing in the product, will continue offering the product and will advance the state of the art within the organization’s 
portfolio of products.

Sales Execution/Pricing: The vendor’s capabilities in all presales activities and the structure that supports them. This includes
