This is a poor facsimilie - it's only really here to register the keywords with Google - but you can go to IBM's original PDF by clicking here.

Note, in passing, that the signature is illegible and not accompanied by the signatory's name - as would be only courteous.  Actually, it was written by IBM's Paul Bercow - but he chose to hide (as he does) behind the anonymising signature of someone in EMEA.  An interesting letter to receive completely out of the blue from someone you've never met, spoken to or corresponded with.  Seems the new American way with justice - guilty without trial and not even knowing the charge.  Yes - now well over 3 years on, IBM (same individual) still refuses to specify the complaint.  And after telling the company no less than thirteen times that this information was freely available.  With lawyers like these, is anyone surprised at the reputation IBM's mainframe efforts have garnered?

It seems opening unsolicited email is now a crime in IBM's eyes.  "Duty of care", anyone?
