VETS GWAC SOLICITATION


SECTION B

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COST


B.1 General


This contract is titled the Veterans Technology Services Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (VETS GWAC or VETS) and is available for use by both Federal Civilian Agencies and the Department of Defense by virtue of the GSA’s Executive Agent Designation from the Office of Management and Budget. It has a base period of five years and one five-year option for a total of ten contract years (actual calendar dates will be set beginning with the date of the notice to proceed). 


VETS GWAC consists of a number of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts designed to provide Federal Government information technology (IT) services and solutions primarily consisting of IT services.

The contracts are solution-based. VETS GWAC contractors are free to propose the best solution to the specific task order requirement provided each order consists principally of IT services. Unless excepted (see FAR 16.505(b)(2)), each task order will be competed under the fair opportunity competitive procedures. The Fair Opportunity competitive procedures will maintain an ongoing competitive environment throughout the life of the contracts. 


B.2 CONTRACT MINIMUM/MAXIMUM


The minimum guaranteed amount for each award will be $2,500. Orders beyond the minimum will be determined by user needs and the results of fair opportunity competitions. The exercise of the option period does not re-establish the contract minimum.

The Government has no obligation to issue task orders to the Contractor beyond the minimum amount specified above. While the awarded contractors will receive the minimum, it is intended that the contractors will compete for that amount under the contract’s fair opportunity procedures. If at the end of the base period of the contract, a contractor has not been awarded a task order(s) of at least $2,500 in total value, the program office may direct awards to meet the contractual obligation pursuant to FAR 16.505(2)(iv). 

The maximum cumulative dollar amount that may potentially be awarded, to all contractors combined, is $5 Billion.


B.3 WORK ESTIMATES (HOURS AND ODCS) & ROLES


This is a new Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) program of the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Service (FSS), Small Business GWAC Center. There is no relevant historical sales trend that may be utilized to project with reasonable certainty, with any degree of reasonable accuracy, the nature or volume of work likely under these Contracts. GSA does not have projects designated/earmarked for this Contract program and they are not guaranteed to be forthcoming.  The different Federal Government entities/potential clients of these Contracts will make their own decisions on the benefits of utilizing VETS GWAC (SB) contracts for IT requirements.  Furthermore, the Multiple Award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (MAIDIQ) contracts awarded under this GWAC are subject to Fair Opportunity procedures emphasizing competition among firms in the selected Functional Areas (FAs). At this time, the breakdown of fixed-price, time & materials and labor hour order distribution is unknown.  Also unknown is the location of work and the breakdown of Government site and Contractor site work. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding the amount of supplies, travel, incidental construction and other direct costs that will be required, although market research reveals that they will be necessary in some cases.  Furthermore, requirements may range from simple to highly complex.


The Government will be obligated to Contract holders only for services, items and quantities specified, approved and definitized in a valid Order issued under an awarded Contract, or, in the event of no Order issuance, for the minimum guarantee established in Section B and elaborated upon in Section H.


B.4  SUPPLIES/SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS


Task orders awarded under this contract may be issued as Fixed-Price (FP), Time and Materials (T&M) or Labor-Hour (L-H), plus Incentive arrangements coupled to the previous types, as defined in FAR Part 16. The prices/costs will be applied to individual task order types as follows:


(SEE EXCEL SPREADSHEETS FOR PRICING IN LEFT HAND NAVIGATION OF VETS WESITE UNDER VETS CONTRACT LIBRARY ENTITLED, “VETS CONTRACT PRICING INFORMATION”)


B.4.1	Fully Loaded Ceiling Rates


These price schedules contain the loaded hourly rates for work performed at any location within CONUS. “Fully loaded hourly ceiling rate” is defined as the direct hourly labor rate that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, profit, fringe benefits,  direct tax/labor/payroll burden and contract access fee. The loaded hourly ceiling rates set forth in this schedule are fully burdened, not-to-exceed, ceiling prices. The contractor may, at its discretion, propose lower loaded hourly ceiling rates on a task-by-task order basis (and this result is typical). Contractors shall post their ceiling rates at their individual VETS GWAC Web Sites.

B.4.2	Adjustments to Contract Ceiling Rates
  

The fully loaded ceiling rates set forth in the price schedules apply to contract years 1 through 5. For contract years 6 through 10, Option Period One (1), the fully loaded ceiling rates will be adjusted in accordance with Section B.9 of this contract.  Any adjustments to ceiling rates will be enacted by contract modification and will become effective on the date shown in the modification.

B.4.3	Adjustments to Task Order Hourly Rates 


Labor-hour (L-H) and time-and-materials (T&M): Task order loaded (loaded pursuant to the specific terms for T&M and L-H loading discussed in this Section B) hourly rates may be adjusted, if specified in the task order Statement of Work (SOW), for each of the option years by applying no more than the same adjustment factor to the task order rates as was applied to the loaded contract ceiling hourly rates. The specific escalation shall be fully definitized in the applicable order, else escalation is not permitted. If an order does not specifically provide for such adjustment, no such adjustment is permitted (order level escalation is not automatic, shall not be presumed, and doesn’t inhere from the Contract to task orders) – the parties to the order may not write it in after the fact.


Fixed Price (FP) tasks:  


	Fixed price task orders and their option periods, if any, shall be fully definitized and pre-priced. Unless the Order definitizes an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) or escalation, none applies (Contract level EPA or escalation doesn’t apply to task orders).

	

	Economic Price Adjustment when Escalation of Order Prices Isn’t Applied - if a task order contains option periods, the task order shall be pre-priced for every period. Such pricing may be pre-priced for each of the option years and coupled with an order specific EPA if order specific EPA terms are fully definitized in the applicable order, else order specific EPA is not permitted. If an order does not specifically provide definitized EPA, no order specific EPA is permitted (order specific EPA is not automatic and shall not be presumed) – the parties to the order may not write it in after the fact.

 

	Escalation of Order Prices when an Economic Price Adjustment Isn’t Applied - if a task order contains option periods, the task order shall be pre-priced for every period. Such pricing may be pre-priced for each of the option years by applying no more than the same adjustment factor to the loaded hourly rates negotiated for the task as was applied to the loaded contract ceiling hourly rates in B.7.  Such adjustments shall be fully definitized in the applicable order, else escalation isn’t permitted. If an order does not specifically provide definitized escalation, no escalation is permitted (escalation is not automatic and shall not be presumed) – the parties to the order may not write it in after the fact.


B.4.4 	Ceiling Handling Rates for FP, T&M and L-H Task Orders

As determined at basic contract award, the contractor has a set of ceiling handling rates to cover allowable indirect charges (but not direct labor burden) and allowable profit for four “classes” of items including:

�
1. Supplies (this includes equipment, software and other tangible items (shall be fully definitized up front in each order)) 

2. Travel (it is permitted to set up a budgetary line item for this in an order with FP, T&M, and L-H terms, and for the controls of the FTR, JTR and JFTR [applicable travel regulations are to be identified in the order] to govern reimbursement) 

3. Incidental Construction (shall be fully definitized up front in each order) 

4. Other Direct Costs (this includes materially DIFFERENT skill categories (shall be fully �definitized up front in each order)) �

As used here, a handling rate is the administrative handling fee inclusive of the Contract Access Fee applied to the base cost of those four classes. The base cost of materially different skill categories includes direct labor burden. The appropriate handling rate is quoted/proposed (often with a reduction to the original ceiling rate as the contractor competes for task orders) as a burden to base costs so that the product of the base cost and handling rate equals item price inclusive of the Contract Access Fee. In effect with the exception of the travel class, the supplies, incidental construction and other direct costs classes are to be turned into fixed price items for every task order, regardless of the terms for other work in the task order (even if the task order is T&M or L-H, the portions for classes 1, 3 and 4 shall be fixed price – without exception). Even though item classes 1, 3 and 4 turn into fixed price items under task orders, contractors shall identify/show a thorough breakout of their base cost and the applied handling rate for each of the four item classes proposed/quoted in response to fair opportunity task order competition. 

During fair opportunity competition for FP, T&M or L-H task orders, contractors may apply handling rates not exceeding their ceiling handling rates in this contract. 

Ceiling handling rates are to include profit/fee as follows: 

(1) Profit/fee is not allowable for travel, shall not be in those rates, and shall never be applied to travel. 


(2) Fee/profit is allowable for the other classes besides travel. Handling Rates for classes 1, 3 and 4 shall be inclusive of fee/profit. No separate application of fee/profit to any of the four classes is permitted – it, like indirect charges, is bounded by the single ceiling handling rate for each class. 


EACH OFFEROR SHALL PROPOSE CEILING HANDLING RATES IN THE PRICING SCHEDULES FOR LINE ITEMS 100 THROUGH 102 FOR ALL PERIODS OF THE FAS APPLIED FOR. FAILURE TO PROPOSE ON ALL CEILING HANDLING RATES FOR ALL PERIODS OF THE FAS APPLIED FOR 

�
shall result in disqualification of the offer in the FA(s) in which the omission occurs.


The ceiling handling rates shall be proposed as a simple percentage limited to two (2) decimal places.  Example:	Ceiling 
Clin	Category	Est. Cost	Handling Rate	TOTAL

101	Travel	$50,000	5.50%	$52,750


The ceiling handling rates shall apply uniformly regardless of actual utilization (i.e., even if only $100 of the estimate amounts is ordered, the ceiling multiplier shall be the same.)


All line items shall be separately orderable. Pricing for all line items must stand-alone and not be dependent upon the ordering of any other line items, except as otherwise identified in the contract.


The ceiling handling rates apply to a prime Contractors' subcontractor support at any tier.


B.4.5	Application of the Service Contract Act (SCA)


The vast majority of labor categories identified in this solicitation are professional IT positions and thus exempt from the SCA. In accordance with Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Labor Standards for Federal Service Contract, the General Services Administration (GSA) considers the Service Contract Act (SCA) to not apply to this contract based upon its principal purpose.

B.4.6 Information Technology Task Orders Involving Some Construction Work


In accordance with FAR 22.402(b) and Section C.8 of this contract, the Davis-Bacon Act may not apply to certain non-construction contracts where some minor construction occurs incidental to the rest of the task order. Specifically, if the construction work is incidental to furnishing IT services and is so merged with the IT portion of the contract that the construction is not capable of being segregated as a separate contractual requirement, it may not be subject to Davis-Bacon.


When minor construction is required as an integral part of a task order, the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) is required to document the Task Order file that the construction portion of the task order is 1) within scope, 2) subject or not subject to the Davis Bacon Act, and 3) fairly and reasonably priced and the basis therefore.


Should the Davis-Bacon Act apply to the construction portion of a Task Order, it is the responsibility of the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) to address any previous union agreements and obtain the applicable Wage Rate Determinations from the Department of Labor. Construction contracting is a contracting specialization in the Government, and ordinarily requires highly specific requirements, specifications, plans, terms and conditions. OCO’s are cautioned to only include construction up to the defined limits and with proper attention to detail.

�


There is additional coverage on construction in Section C.



B.5 RESERVED


B.6 FULLY LOADED HOURLY CEILING RATES


The labor pricing schedules that follow call for hourly ceiling rates, which are the maximum fully loaded hourly rates to be proposed for work for entities authorized in GSA Order ADM 4800.2E (found in Section J).


 When formulating each hourly ceiling rate, the CAF shall be applied last. 


The Government will neither pay a premium/differential for overtime (work in excess of 40 hours in a week), nor for work during irregular hours, weekends or holidays. 


The ceiling rates do not serve as a mechanical measure of the rates to be quoted or proposed at the order level. All order rates must be lower than or equal to the ceiling rates (work scope specifics and competition will influence the rates a contractor chooses to quote or propose for a task order opportunity.)  


Each offeror shall propose ceiling prices in the pricing schedules for all labor categories and all periods of the FAs applied for.  Failure to propose pricing for all labor categories and all periods of the FAs applied for shall result in disqualification of the offer in the FA(s) in which the omission occurs.


The hourly ceiling price proposed shall apply uniformly regardless of actual utilization (i.e., even if only 5 hours of the estimated hours are ordered, the hourly ceiling rate shall be the same.)


All line items shall be separately orderable. Pricing for all line items must stand-alone and not be dependent upon the ordering of any other line items.


The labor categories and ceiling rates apply to a prime Contractors' subcontractor support at any tier.


The attached labor category descriptions are stated in terms of minimum qualifications/responsibilities and do not attempt to delineate the universe of responsibilities associated with a labor category by the commercial market. Contractors shall not be allowed to divert work from pre-defined labor categories to other labor categories based on a restrictive or hyper technical reading of labor category descriptions.  


The following numbered notes apply to all pricing tables:

�

1. Minor (incidental) construction work subject to the Davis-Bacon Act that is ordered under this contract pursuant to the acceptable use terms established for its inclusion shall not exceed 10% of cumulative earned order value at any time during the life of this contract


2. The price evaluation case will be made on 100% of the extended item totals.  This methodology doesn’t constitute a promised level of business or alter the minimum guarantee


3. In no event will the Government agree to an individual item price or rate that is unreasonable, even if the arithmetic is satisfactory in the price evaluation case

�
B.9 OPTION PERIOD ONE (1) – YEARS SIX (6) THROUGH TEN (10) 
Pricing for Option Period One (1) will be evaluated using the ceiling rates and ceiling multipliers designated in Year Five (5) of the pricing tables for the base period. The base period Year Five rates and multipliers will be extrapolated out to years six through ten automatically by the Government for proposal evaluation purposes. 

The actual ceiling rates and ceiling multipliers for Option Period One (1) will be determined by escalating the proposed Year Five (5) ceiling rates and ceiling multipliers utilizing the latest methodology and basis for the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI for “Professional, Specialty, and Technical Occupations” will be controlling. A simple “percentage” method will be used. 

The Government does not intend to perform redeterminations or apply escalated rates retroactively. The escalation will not apply to orders already awarded (in place) unless they specifically definitize its inclusion. The specific ECI we are using as the basis for adjustment is titled “WAGES AND SALARIES (not seasonally adjusted): Employment Cost Index for wages and salaries, private industry workers, by industry and occupational group”.
B.9.1 Frequency of Adjustment 
The contract adjustment will be calculated three months prior to Option Period One using the latest ECI information available at that time (providing GSA a three month window to prepare the escalation documentation) and implemented at the beginning of year six (Option Period One – if exercised). The Government intends to use the average of the five previous full years of ECI data to make a one time contract escalation. This escalation will be applied one time to years six through ten ceiling rates and ceiling multipliers – to remain fixed thereafter.   

The calculated escalation rate will be applied consecutively for years six through ten. This means that the escalation rate will have compounding effect for years six through ten.  It will be applied one time for the option period as the RFP currently states. Each year in the option period will have separate pricing as a result.

�

B.9.2 Materially Unbalanced Offers 
Offerors shall offer pricing on all items correctly and price each item as specified. The Government will reject a mathematically unbalanced offer if the offer is also materially unbalanced. A mathematically unbalanced offer is an offer containing lump sum or unit price items that do not include reasonable labor, equipment, and material costs plus a reasonable proportionate share of the Offeror’s overhead costs, other indirect costs, and anticipated profit. An offer is materially unbalanced when the Government determines that an award to the Offeror submitting a mathematically unbalanced offer will not result in the lowest ultimate cost to the Government and/or not fair to other Offeror’s whose pricing is balanced. 

The Government will pay particularly close attention to the Year Five (5) ceiling rates and ceiling multipliers being proposed by Offerors. These rates and multipliers will be used for extrapolating the Option Period One pricing for evaluation purposes. If the Government detects any unbalanced pricing in Year Five of the base period and/or “gaming” in order to have more favorable evaluated pricing for the Option Period, those offers will be rejected. �

B.10 FOREIGN AREA TRAVEL/WORK 
 

The U.S. State Department, Bureau of Administration, Office of Allowances (http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/) develops and coordinates policies, regulations, standards, and procedures to administer the government-wide allowances and benefits program abroad under the Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR). 

 

The U.S. State Department sets per diem rate maximums for foreign areas, which are authorized for incorporation on individual orders by Ordering Contracting Officers (OCOs).  For more information refer to http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/prdm/.  The contractor’s handling rate for travel applies to all travel, be it domestic, non-contiguous or foreign. 

 

The U.S. Department of State publishes quarterly report indexes of living costs abroad, quarters’ allowances, hardship differentials, and danger pay allowances (http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/qtrpt/).  Table 1 – Indexes of Living Costs Abroad; and Table 3 – Hardship Differentials and Danger Pay (with the exception of Danger Pay - see last paragraph in this section concerning travel warnings to Americans and Danger Pay locations) are specifically incorporated into the contract.   

 

Concerning Table 1. The appropriate column to use for adjustments is “Local Index”.  These allowances are the maximum adjustment permitted to pre-established professional service line item ceiling rates for work in the applicable foreign area.   

 

Concerning Table 2 – Quarters Allowance. The contractor does not automatically gain this allowance for foreign country work. OCOs may negotiate and incorporate this allowance on individual orders. 

 

Concerning Danger Pay. Work is not authorized in areas the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to or to areas the U.S. State Department has issued Danger Pay Differentials. If there is a change in area status during order performance (e.g., the U.S. State Department warns Americans not to travel there or issues a Danger Pay Differential for the area), then the ordering contracting officer shall determine if it is, or isn’t, in the Government’s best interest for that work to continue, document their findings in the written order record and take appropriate contractual actions. Contractors have an affirmative duty to monitor area status during order performance and promptly coordinate with the applicable OCO(s) on changes in area status.  


B.11 DEFINITIONS 
a. 	The terms Skill Category and Labor Category are synonymous. 

b. 	On-Site: 	Work performed on Government facility 

Off-Site: 	Work performed on Contractor facility.

SECTION C


STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1	GENERAL/BACKGROUND


Government-wide Acquisition Contracts or GWACs are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts for various information technology (IT) resources negotiated, awarded and administered by one particular agency but available to other Federal agencies for purchases. Each GWAC is operated by an executive agent, such as the General Services Administration, designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to section 5112(e) of the Clinger-Cohen Act.  In accordance with Section 5112(e) of the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), 40 U.S.C. § 1412(e), “the Director [of the Office of Management and Budget] may designate one or more heads of Executive agencies as executive agents for Government-wide acquisitions of information technology.” GWACs are not subject to the requirements and limitations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535.


GWACs are valuable tools for the acquisition of information technology services and supplies, but the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) must ensure that:  (1) the GWAC is not used to circumvent applicable agency policies or regulations; (2) the ordering agency properly administers all contract terms and conditions and adheres to Federal Acquisition Regulations and policy; (3) agency requirements are within the scope of the master GWAC contract; and (4) subsequent task orders are within the scope of the contract.  


C.2	OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation and the resulting VETS GWAC is to provide civilian agencies and the Department of Defense (DoD) the ability to obtain a broad range of Comprehensive IT support services in a timely and cost-effective manner under a multiple award contract.  VETS GWAC is a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (MA/IDIQ) contract providing a wide range of information technology support services, while providing the greatest amount of flexibility possible to efficiently and effectively support agency daily operations, protection of infrastructure, the fight against terrorism, and the development and marketing of emerging technologies.  The VETS GWAC is accessible to civilian agencies and DoD and is designed to achieve innovative solutions and best value products and services to support Federal  Agencies worldwide. 


C.3	SCOPE

VETS GWAC is a Multiple Award/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (MA/IDIQ) to provide worldwide Information Technology (IT) solutions to client agencies. VETS GWAC is designed to provide the greatest amount of flexibility possible to efficiently and effectively support the federal government's needs in its daily operations, its protection of infrastructure, the fight against terrorism and the development and marketing of emerging technologies.  To this end, VETS GWAC was created to fulfill the Information

�
Technology (IT) requirements of GSA and other Federal Agencies.  Work may be performed at headquarters and/or field offices located throughout the world, as specified in each task order, to provide a variety of IT support services, including new and emerging technologies which will evolve over the life of VETS GWAC.  The scope of work under this contract is defined as within the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes defined in C.9 of this statement of work.  The Government shall order services under this contract by means of task orders with specifically defined scopes, deliverable products, and schedules.   “VETS order terms include fixed-price (all in FAR 16.2), time-and-materials (per FAR 16.6) and labor-hour (per FAR 16.6). VETS also allows requiring activities to choose among the incentive features found in FAR 16.4 that are tied to fixed-price, time-and-materials and labor-hour terms.”


C.4 TASK ORDERS 
The work description is intended to outline the general requirements  of contractors awarded VETS GWAC contracts. Specific details of work assignments, deliverables, documentation, training, applicable government/departmental/industry standards, etc., will be provided in individual task orders, preferably performance based.  The anticipated services require a diversity of skills suitable to a multitude of information technology environments in support of a variety of IT support areas.  The contractor shall perform work under this contract only as directed in task orders issued by authorized COs. The Contractor shall ensure adequate resources are dedicated to satisfy the requirements of work assignments including, but not limited to, furnishing the necessary personnel, material, services, and facilities, as required. In addition, inherent in providing these goods and services, the Contractor shall provide the supervision and management effort necessary for efficient and effective administration and control of work performed under VETS GWAC. 

C.5 SECURITY CLEARANCES 
Performance of this contract may require access to varying levels of secured information and/or areas. This will be determined on individual task orders.  As such, contractor personnel must have a current clearance appropriate to the level of security identified in the task order. See Section H.8 for information on security requirements.   

C.6 TRAVEL 
Contractor travel may be required for this contract in performance of an individual task order and will be reimbursed to the Contractor in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations, Joint Travel Regulations, and Joint Federal Travel Regulations. 

C.7 HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND/OR LICENSING 
Integral to the services necessary in performing task orders in the designated functional areas, acquisition of hardware/software and/or licensing of software from 3rd  party sources may also be required of the Contractor.  Under any of these functional areas, a task order may be used to acquire hardware/software that is integral to the services being provided. Purchase of hardware/software or licenses of software from 3rd party sources in support of task orders in any functional area shall not impact the 

�
determination of the appropriate functional area classification of the task order.  Functional area classification shall be determined solely upon the preponderance of services provided. The types of hardware/software envisioned would include, but are not limited to, such items as: network devices, switches, routers, bridges, hubs, protocol translators, modems, cabling, wiring closet hardware, wireless access devices, voice and data integration products, Defense Message System (DMS) peripherals, Internet and electronic commerce access gateways, IT infrastructure hardware/software utilities, CASE tools (e.g., Oracle Case, ER-WIN, Predict, System Architect, Knowledgeware, Frontier Super TCP, Netscape, Web Browser), models, database management systems, personal computers, workstations, servers, printers, application software products, compact disk/read only memory (CD/ROM), digital libraries, imaging and optical character recognition equipment, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items, general supplies, etc. Technological refreshment/enhancements of hardware/software as well as special access considerations for IT resources may be required by individual task orders

C.8 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TASK ORDERS INVOLVING SOME CONSTRUCTION WORK 
In the event that alteration or minor construction of real property is required to achieve the primary purpose of a Task Order issued against the VETS GWAC contract, such alteration or minor construction shall be deemed within the scope of this contract. 

The expressed purpose of the VETS GWAC contracts is to provide ordering agencies a wide range of information technology support services using the latest technology and systems. It is not the intent of the VETS GWAC contracts to do “minor construction” unrelated to Information Technology requirements.  Minor construction is considered as acceptable work under the VETS GWAC contracts only when it is incidental to a larger Information Technology task order. 

In any event, the “minor construction” portion of an Information Technology task order issued against this contract may not exceed any statutory, regulatory, or policy limitations imposed by the Ordering Agency applicable to construction.  For example, if the Ordering Agency regulates and/or imposes thresholds for the use of O&M dollars for “minor construction” imbedded in Task Orders for other than construction, those same limitations will apply to task orders issued against the VETS GWAC contracts. 

The Davis-Bacon Act requirements apply to construction work to be performed as part of Information Technology task orders under this contract if-  

(1) The construction work is to be performed on a public building or public work;  

(2) The contract contains specific requirements for a substantial amount of construction work exceeding the monetary threshold for application of the Davis-Bacon Act (the word "substantial" relates to the type and quantity of construction work to be performed and not merely to the total value of construction work as compared to the total value of the contract); and  

(3) The construction work is physically or functionally separate from, and is capable of being performed on a segregated basis from, the other work required by the contract. 

�
The Davis-Bacon Act requirements do not apply if- 

The construction work is incidental to the furnishing of supplies, equipment, or services (for example, the requirements do not apply to simple installation or alteration at a public building or public work that is incidental to furnishing supplies or equipment under a supply contract; however, if a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, or repair is required, such as for installation of heavy generators or large refrigerator systems or for plant modification or rearrangement, the requirements of this subpart apply); or 

The construction work is so merged with non- construction work or so fragmented in terms of the locations or time spans in which it is to be performed, that it is not capable of being segregated as a separate contractual requirement.


Should the Davis-Bacon Act apply to the construction portion of a Task Order, it is the responsibility of the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) to obtain the applicable Wage Rate Determinations from the Department of Labor.


C.9	ORDERING AGENCY STANDARDS


Each ordering agency/organizational component will specify the standards, which the Contractor shall follow in performance of a prospective task order.  The Contractor shall be required to work according to the architectures, standards, guidelines, and procedures as stated in individual task orders, including, but not limited to, various standards as set forth in agency guidance.

Premises 

F.3 TERM OF CONTRACT AND ORDERS 
The base term of this contract is five (5) years with one five-year option period. The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options, shall not exceed ten (10) years from the date of Contract Award.  

�
Orders may only be issued during the contract’s five year base period or the five year option period, if exercised. Those periods of time shall be called the “Contract Ordering Period” (COP).  At all times each order’s terms shall be consistent with its appropriation.  For example, a severable task order may be issued for the balance of a fiscal year and then must be built with option periods contingent upon the availability of future year funds, whereas a non-severable task order may be issued for a period of time commensurate with the appropriation’s terms (with or without options), but may not exceed the COP by more than 36 months.  If an awardee’s size status changes as a result of size status recertification at the contract option period such that the contract option isn’t exercised, order performance may still be completed, and order option’s may still be exercised. The Government will change the Federal Procurement Data System classification for the contract award such that the options are credited as work with a large business. The COP is the same as the order issue period referenced in FAR 52.216-18 in Section I of this contract. 




�
SECTION G


CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA



The Contractor shall provide all management, administrative, marketing, quotation, proposal, clerical and supervisory functions and actions required for effective and efficient Contract administration without direct cost to the Government.

G.1 GENERAL


The following paragraphs shall be applicable to all Task Orders issued under this contract. Any additional requirements will be specified in individual Task Orders.


G.2 AUTHORITY


G.2.1 GSA PROCURING CONTRACTING OFFICER (PCO)


The right to issue contract modifications, change the terms and conditions of the basic contract, terminate the contract, exercise option renewals, and approve teaming arrangements and contract administration is reserved to the PCO unless otherwise delegated in writing to an Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). 


The Procuring Contracting Officer will provide to the contractor in writing the Government personnel to whom they have delegated responsibility and authority under the contract.  These personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of the contract, orders issued against the contract, and ensuring adherence to all appropriations law.


For this contract, the PCO is located at the following address:


General Services Administration

Federal Supply Service

Small Business GWAC Center

1500 E. Bannister Road

Kansas City, MO  64131


Additional responsibilities of the PCO include, but not limited to:


Appointing Administrative Contracting Officers (ACO) as appropriate

Issuing Ordering  Contracting Officer (OCO) delegations of procurement authority and Notifying Industry Partners of delegations

Granting contract waivers

Reviewing sole source requirements 

Approving all Industry Partners Teaming Arrangements

Managing a Past Performance Database


G.2.2 GSA PROGRAM MANAGER (PM)


The GSA Program Manager (PM) will provide centralized technical oversight and management regarding VETS GWAC contracts to the Contractors, other GSA personnel, and their designated customers.  The GSA Program Manager is the representative for the GSA Small Business GWAC Center. Unless specifically identified by GSA, this will be the PCO.


G.2.3 ORDERING CONTRACTING OFFICER (OCO)


G.2.3.1 APPOINTMENT OF THE OCO


The GSA Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) will delegate OCO duties to Contracting Officers to assure orderly performance of Task Orders.  This designation is processed through a Delegation of Contract Ordering Authority (DCOA) and must be requested by the ordering agency through the PCO. The general process for requesting a DCOA is to e:mail the PCO from a “.gov” or “.mil” e:mail account (ending in that nomenclature) requesting it and to provide a copy of the warrant for all parties desiring to be an OCO. Training will be scheduled and must be completed satisfactorily by the designated OCO(s). Upon completion of those prerequisites, a DOCA document will be issued for signature. Once returned and executed by the PCO, and then returned to the newly appointed OCO, the OCO may proceed to use the GWAC. All contracting officers must obtain a Delegation of Contract Ordering Authority from the GSA PCO to issue, modify, and terminate Task Orders under this contract prior to using it. The contractor shall direct all written inquiries, pertaining to specific Task Orders, of a technical or non‑technical nature through the OCO.  The PCO is available if an OCO is not responsive.


G.2.4	OCO’s REPRESENTATIVE


The Ordering Contracting Officer will appoint a Contracting Officer's Representative (OCO COR or OCO COTR) in writing for each Task Order.  The OCO COR will receive all work called for by the Task Order for the Government and will represent the OCO in the technical phases of the work.  The OCO COR will provide no supervisory or instructional assistance to Contractor personnel.


The OCO COR is not authorized to change any of the terms and conditions of the Contract or the Task Order.  Changes in the scope of work of the Task Order will be made only by the OCO by properly executed modifications to the task order.


G.3 SUPERVISION


The contractor shall provide supervision for all contractor personnel on Task Orders.  The Government will have no direct supervision over contractor personnel.  Government actions with respect to contractor personnel will conform to all applicable policies, regulations, and law including the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 37. Contractor employees working under this contract and resultant Task Orders must wear identification that clearly identifies them as contractor employees that identifies the company they represent. 


G.4 NOTIFICATION OF TASK ORDER CHANGE

If in the Contractor's opinion, the OCO requests or indicates an expectation of effort which would justify or require an equitable adjustment to the applicable Task Order, the Contractor shall promptly notify the OCO for the Task Order in question in writing, pursuant to FAR 52.243‑7 Notification of Changes, but take no other action on that request or effort until the OCO for the applicable Task Order has issued an appropriate contract administration action for the Task Order, or otherwise resolves the issue.  Failure to follow the Notification of Changes procedure at the Task Order level shall be solely at the Contractor’s risk.  


G.5 RESERVED

G.6	TASK ORDER PRICING/COST 


All Task Orders issued against this contract shall be priced out/”costed” out consistent with the identified order terms (FP, T&M or LH and any incentives – or combination thereof – in accordance with the FAR). The Contractor shall not accept unpriced Task Orders.


G.7	RESERVED


G.8 	BILLING DISPUTES

All billing disputes arising under or otherwise relating to this Contract or any Task Order issued hereunder shall be resolved pursuant to the procedure set-forth in FAR Clause 52.233-1 Disputes.  The OCO for the applicable Task Order is the Contracting Officer for purposes of receiving and processing a claim, and rendering a final decision, as applicable.


For those disputed amounts for which the Contracting Officer issues a decision under the Contracts Disputes Act (CDA), the Government will withhold from a subsequent invoice an amount equivalent to the disputed amount. This type of dispute is a CDA contract dispute to be managed by the Contracting Officer.  


G.9 TASK ORDERS	


At a minimum, the following paragraphs shall be applicable to all Task Orders (TO) issued under this Contract.  Additional requirements may be specified in each TO.


Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of written Task Orders.  All Task Orders issued under this contract shall be issued in accordance with FAR 16.505 Ordering and the following:  	

OCOs and contractors must develop a complete integrated understanding of the contract.  Certain topics are repeated in various contract sections, often with unique content in each.

All costs associated with preparation, presentation, submission and/or discussion of the Task Order proposals and quotations will be at the contractor's expense (at no direct cost to the government).

No work shall be performed and no payment shall be made except as authorized by a Task Order.


A Task Order is issued when the Government transmits the Task Order to the contractor.
Orders will be within the scope of the contract, will be issued within the period of performance, will be within the maximum value of the contract and will follow the fair opportunity process.

Orders will be placed with the contractor selected by the ordering Agency following established ordering procedures. Orders may be placed using any channel that provides fair opportunity.  Such channels/systems as ITSS, GSA Preferred, E-Buy and a contractor provided e: mail account (that remains constant for the life of the GWAC, so it shouldn’t in one person’s name, but rather a general e: mail for the firm, perhaps one set up specifically for this purpose), and facsimile are viable. Contractors shall maintain their registrations and accounts in the various systems identified by GSA as “fair opportunity channels”, and should diligently monitor them for opportunities.  This applies to GSA E-Library too, although it is not a fair opportunity channel.  The Government reserves the right to select a single fair opportunity channel after award if it deems it is in its best interest.

Only an authorized and delegated OCO can issue an order under this contract.

All costs associated with post issuance order administration (including applicable personnel cost allocations by TO) shall not be chargeable to the Government as a direct cost. The Contractor is responsible for determining the most appropriate method for inclusion of such costs in indirect pools based on its standard accounting practices.


G.9.1	FAIR OPPORTUNITY PROCESS


Authorized users (or GSA acting on their behalf) will use the fair opportunity process specified in FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(1) in selecting order contractors.  

Ordering Contracting Officers from the Agencies will develop and document the process according to FAR standards.  OCOs should review and become very familiar with FAR 16.505.

Competitive order contractor selection criteria will be established by the OCO.

Tradeoff or low price - technically acceptable evaluations are authorized.

Price is always a required evaluation factor for source selection based upon merit.

Past performance is always a required evaluation factor for task orders estimated to be valued at over $100,000.00.

The Government may require oral presentations. 

The Government may evaluate quotations and proposals without discussions.

Formal evaluation plans or rating of quotes or offers is not required.  However, the amount of acquisition planning, evaluation and documentation should be commensurate with the estimated value, inherent risk of performance and importance of the order. For example, the Agency’s initial selection of which contractor to utilize should have substantially more planning and evaluation for a higher risk, higher valued order than on a lower risk, lower valued one.

Use of any method (such as allocation or designation of any preferred contractor) that would result in fair consideration not being given to all FA contractors is prohibited.

Use of a multi-phased approach when effort required to respond may be resource intensive is possible – the OCO should confer with the PCO on implementation. Generally, the best practice is to send out an initial notification to all FA based contractors stating a concise requirement synopsis with salient characteristics. Contractors will be afforded a short time in which to elect to “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving the formal RFQ or RFP.  Failure to opt in constitutes opting out. Contractors opting in would be sent the formal RFQ or RFP.  

Formal RFQs or RFPs should afford offerors a reasonable period of time to respond to, taking into account the unique requirement circumstances – and the OCO will establish that time frame. Contractors are not required to quote or propose for task orders (this does not void the minimum revenue requirement).   Time should be allotted to promote competition.  

When the Ordering Agency or GSA on the Agency’s behalf, makes its decision, the OCO shall document in the order file the rationale for placement and price of each order (price analysis/a price reasonableness determination is always required for FP, T&M and LH work ***), including the basis for order contractor selection and the rationale for any tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost considerations. Best evaluation practices and agency specific guidance should be followed. The order file shall also identify the basis for using any of the four exceptions to the fair opportunity process. If the OCO uses the logical follow-on exception, the rationale shall describe why the relationship between the initial order and the follow-on qualifies for the exception (the original competition must have been under the same GWAC.)  It is the Agency’s responsibility to produce and maintain the required documentation for each order regardless of the dollar value of the order.

Following the order placement decision and the documentation of the decision, the ordering Agency or GSA on the Agency’s behalf will place the order with the selected contractor.

There must remain at least three active contracts in a FA for the FA to be utilized for Fair Opportunity Competition. If the number of qualified awardees in a FA falls below three, it will act as a stay to the utilization of those less than three contracts for new order competition (but not for issued task orders or for those new orders issued under a bona-fide Fair Opportunity Exception) until such a time as three contract awards in the FA are in effect. The Government will make efforts to maintain the minimum level of three contract awardees per functional area through an open season (and may conduct an open season then without consideration of number of awardees remaining in the FA award pool when in it is in the Government’s interest) at the option period, and from time to time, with the understanding that doing so remains at the Government’s discretion and that the length of any open season acquisition cycle is a matter subject to many variables outside of the Government’s control. No specific promises regarding open season timing, duration or outcomes are expressed or implied.

G.9.2	EXCEPTIONS TO THE FAIR OPPORTUNITY PROCESS


Orders may be issued on a sole-source basis whenever circumstances warrant the exercise of any exception set forth in FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(2).  In accordance with FAR 15.505(b)(2) fair opportunity need not apply to orders that are under $2,500, and is excepted for service orders above $2,500 where the Contracting Officer determines that:


The need for the services ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need.

Only one contractor is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique or highly specialized.

The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued on a competitive basis.

It is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor to satisfy the minimum revenue guarantee (A PCO determination only.) 


As with any decision under the fair opportunity process, OCO must document the use of any exception to the Fair Opportunity Process.  Certain Agencies may place additional Agency requirements for use of an exception to the fair opportunity process.  In all instances the Agency or the Agency conducting the fair opportunity process on behalf of another Agency, must fulfill the requiring Agency’s additional requirements for use of an exception and the documentation required.


G.9.3	Order Conditions


Funding for each Order shall be contained in the Order and not in the Contract. The contract minimum guarantee is intended to be met by Orders and not by an outright payment from the SBSDC. Issuance of a single Order or a series of Orders having a cumulative value equal to or greater than the minimum guarantee satisfies the minimum guarantee.


Services will be Ordered by issuance of written Orders on GSA Form 300, Standard Form 1449 or DD Form 1155. Other Agency specific forms may be considered for approval by the PCO on a case-by-case basis. Oral Orders are not authorized. Facsimile issuance of Orders is authorized and such Orders are considered to be properly issued when error free transmission is complete.  


No work will be performed, no debt or obligation accrued and no payment will be made except as authorized by a bona-fide written Order signed by a duly warranted and delegated OCO. Contractors work AT RISK if they perform work under an order that is not bona-fide or is not signed by a duly warranted and delegated OCO – and should implement the necessary checks and balances within their organizations to ensure that doesn’t occur.


A bona-fide Order will include all of the following elements as applicable, the lack of a single applicable element makes an Order defective. Non bona-fide Orders shall be brought to the immediate attention of the PCO and all Government personnel listed on the face of the Order for dispositioning:


Date of Order

GSA Contract number

Government Order number 

Appropriation and accounting data

Description of service(s) to be performed (preferably a performance based statement of work)

Period(s) of performance, performance timeframe(s) and performance deadline(s)

Place(s) of performance

Price/risk arrangements (order terms, i.e. FP or T&M)

Definitized order pricing

Definitized ceilings, if any

Signature of duly warranted and delegated OCO

Billing/Invoice address

Name of issuing Agency

Name, signature and phone number of OCO

Name of Client Agency (if different from issuing Agency)

Name of Contractor


The Contractor shall be bound by the terms and conditions in the Contract and in Orders.  Every effort shall be made to find the terms and conditions of an Order meaningful and in harmony with/as complementary to those of the Contract. In the event of a conflict between a term in an Order and in the Contract, the Contract shall control.  Patent conflicts should be resolved during the RFQ/RFP process, else the risk inheres to the contractor.


Only the PCO is authorized to modify any Contract terms and conditions.


Any required change to an issued Order may only be made in writing by a duly warranted and delegated OCO with proper delegated authority.


G.10	PROTESTS AND COMPLAINTS


No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under this contract, except for a protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract (10 U.S.C. 2304c(d) and 41 U.S.C. 253j(d)).


An order ombudsman has been appointed to review complaints from contractors and ensure they are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures set forth above.  The order ombudsman is a senior GSA official who is independent of the GSA Contracting Officer.  The order ombudsman does not have the authority to overturn ordering decisions or to adjudicate formal contract disputes.


The Ombudsman will be responsible for the duties described at FAR 16.505(b)(5).  The Ombudsman for GSA is:�

G.12	 INVOICE SUBMISSION


Proper invoices shall be submitted to the address designated in orders in accordance with the clauses in Section E and I.


Only original invoices shall be submitted.  Invoices must be plainly marked with the heading "Invoice" or substantially similar.  Invoices marked "Statement" or similar are not acceptable and will not be processed.

Invoices must contain the following or they will be rejected. Ordering agencies may specify additional mandatory invoice data elements:

G.15 	Contract/Task Order Closeout


The OCO will be responsible for closing out their orders. Notification that a closeout of a Task Order is completed must be provided to the PCO. Order closeout will be accomplished within the guidelines set forth in:


FAR Part 4 Administrative Matters

FAR Part 42 Contract Administration and Audit Services


The OCO will determine that the following conditions have been met:


The contractor has completed provision of the required services, service has been terminated, and no additional deliverables will be provided.

The contractor’s final invoice has been submitted. 

The contractor has been paid and all billing dispute issues have been resolved.

The Task Order is neither in litigation nor under appeal.

The Task Order period has expired.


The contractor agrees to work in partnership with the contracting officer to closeout Task Orders as soon as possible after they are physically complete by using the “Quick Closeout” procedures described in FAR 42.708 as much as practical. Since this is primarily a services contract, it is anticipated that the costs under non-labor CLINS are to be an insignificant amount to the extent that will allow for the provisional rates established to be used as the basis to negotiate final costs on Non-Fixed-Price Task Orders issued under the contract. However, the OCO for each Task Order has the authority to require an audit of final indirect rates, as provided in FAR 52.232-7, when determined necessary to protect the Government’s interest.



G.16 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS


G.16.1 RESERVED


G.16.2 REGULAR CONTRACTOR REPORTING


G.16.2.1 CONTRACT STATUS REPORT


This report shall detail all financial, staffing and vacancies, training, marketing, and problems contract-wide by calendar quarter (January 1–March 31, April 1–June 30, July 1–September 30, and October 1–December 31).  The contract status report shall reflect same dollar values reported on the Contractor Sales Reporting (see G.17). The report is due within 30 calendar days following the end of the reporting quarter to the Small Business GWAC Center via e-mail.  


G.16.2.2 CONTRACTOR SALES REPORTING AND CONTRACT ACCESS FEE REMITTANCE (December 2004)

(a)  Sales Reporting

The Contractor shall electronically report all sales under this contract.  “Sales” means the dollar amount invoiced under the Task Order.


The contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U. S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, by calendar quarter (January 1–March 31, April 1–June 30, July 1–September 30, and October 1–December 31).


Reports, including “zero” sales, shall be submitted electronically via an Internet website designated by the General Services Administration (GSA)’s Federal Supply Service.


The contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the “Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange” issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service.  The contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter.  The report is available from Financial Management Services, International Funds Branch, Telephone:202-874-7994, Internet: http://www.fms.treas.gov/intn.html.


The report is due within 30 calendar days following the end of the reporting quarter.  The contractor shall continue to furnish quarterly reports, including “zero” sales, as follows:


Final invoice submission for all fixed price, time-and-materials and labor hour orders

Final closeout of all cost-reimbursement orders


Prior to using the reporting system, the contractor shall complete contract registration with the FSS Vendor Support Center (VSC).  The VSC website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided within 60 days of contract award.  FSS reserves the unilateral right to change such instruction from time to time, following notification to the contractor.


Reporting will be by contract at the Task Order level.  Reports for multiple contracts shall not be consolidated.


Failure to submit required reports or the falsification of reports is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for default under the termination provisions of this contract.


(b) Contract Access Fee Remittance


The Contract Access Fee reimburses GSA’s Federal Supply Service for the costs of operating the GWAC program.  The CAF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales reported.  The CAF is currently 3/4 % or .0075.


The CAF percentage is set at the discretion of GSA’s FSS.  FSS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but not more than once per year.  FSS will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of any change.  FSS will post notice of the current CAF at http://vsc.gsa.gov and drilling down into the GWAC section, specifically http://gwac.gsa.gov, or successor website as appropriate.


The contractor shall remit the CAF to FSS in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter.  Final CAF payment is due within 30 calendar days after physical completion of the last outstanding Task Order under the contract.


Instructions for remitting the CAF are contained in the Vendor Support Center website referenced above.  If paying by check, each check shall be annotated with the corresponding contract number and reporting quarter.


Where multiple invoices and/or multiple Task Orders under this contract are involved, the CAF may be consolidated into one payment.  CAF payments for multiple contracts or reporting quarters shall not be consolidated.


FSS will provide the Contractor with specific written instructions on remitting the CAF.  FSS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.


Within 60 days of contract award, an FSS representative will provide the Contractor with specific written instructions on remitting the CAF.  FSS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.


Failure to remit the full amount of the CAF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR 32.6.  The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR 52.232-17, Interest).  The Contractor’s failure to timely pay the CAF is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for default under the termination provisions of this contract.


G.17 SUBCONTRACTING REPORT

In implementing the requirements set forth in FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting, contractors shall follow the subcontracting reporting process established for 8(a) certified firms at 13 CFR 124.510.  Contractors shall maintain up-to-date records concerning subcontracting costs and shall submit the standardized report found in Section J semi-annually (using the contract year) no later than 30 calendar days after each six-month reporting period (RP).  The first RP will begin on the effective date of the notice to proceed.


A separate report shall be completed for each functional area.  The completed report shall be submitted to:


	Small Business GWAC Center

	Attn: VETS GWAC Subcontract Report

	1500 E. Bannister Road  (6FG-C)

	Kansas City, MO  64131

Contract options for contractors not in full compliance with FAR 52.219-14 may not be exercised.  Willful failure or refusal to furnish the required reports, or gross negligence in managing the subcontracting limitation, or falsification of reports 	CONSTITUTES SUFFICIENT CAUSE TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACTOR FOR DEFAULT.


G.18 MEETINGS


G.18.1 GWAC LEVEL MEETINGS


Quarterly GWAC Program Meetings (QPM) shall be necessary to market services, resolve problems, or to facilitate understanding of the requirements of the contract. The participants at these meetings shall include the Industry Partner Contract Manager, Small Business GWAC Center staff, and other representatives of the Government. The PCO and the Industry Partner shall schedule these meetings. All Industry Partner costs associated with the attendance at these meetings shall be at no direct cost to the Government. The Government may, at its option, hold QPRs in person, by teleconference or by webinar.


G.18.2 TASK ORDER LEVEL MEETINGS


From time to time meetings should take place between the ordering agency OCO, OCO COTR and other agency representatives invited by the OCO and a contractor management representative. Such meetings are useful to address progress on the task(s), problems that have arisen over the past month, and other matters that are pertinent.  The Government encourages open dialogue and communications between the parties. Scheduled meetings may be specified in RFQs or RFPs and resulting orders. Contractors are encouraged to participate in such meetings without direct cost to the Government.

G.21  Current & Past Performance Information (IAW FAR 42.15)


It is the government’s intent to collect performance evaluations for each Order.  The requiring office will assess the Contractor's performance in areas such as quality, quantity and timeliness. Such ratings may have bearing on the Contractor's likelihood to receive future Orders. 

It is incumbent upon the requiring OCO, or the OCO COR if directed by the OCO, to complete a performance record for each Order after completion of work, and at least annually for Orders having a performance period in excess of one year.  Performance evaluations should be submitted to the PCO. Contractors should be cognizant of this requirement and exercise their right to contribute to the final performance record. Organizations of caliber will not only plan for good performance, but also be aware of their current performance as perceived by the Government, and take steps (i.e., requesting interim evaluations, holding meetings with the Government, performing required corrective action, etc.) to ensure performance is satisfactory throughout the life of each Order so that there will be no surprises at the completion of work.  


Contractors are invited to document their performance under each Contract Order and submit it to the PCO. This standing invitation constitutes the Government’s effort to afford an opportunity for Contractors to address adverse ratings before they are utilized in a future selection process. A file of all received performance records received by the PCO and any Contractor supplemental information received by the PCO will be maintained and made available to interested parties having a bona-fide need to know. 


The Government may designate a web-based past performance system for this purpose.


G.22 Observance of Federal Holidays


(a) Government personnel observe the following holidays, also shown at www.opm.gov/fedhol.  


New Year's Day

Martin Luther Kings, Jr.'s Birthday

President's Day

Memorial Day

Independence Day

Labor Day

Columbus Day

Veteran's Day

Thanksgiving Day

Christmas Day


Any other day designated by Federal statute, Executive Order or the President's proclamation.


(b) When any holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday is observed.  When any holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is observed.  Observance of such days by Government personnel shall not, by itself, be cause for an equitable adjustment, except if specifically authorized in an Order.


(c) It is understood and agreed between the Government and the Contractor that observance of such days by Government personnel shall not otherwise be a reason for an additional period of performance, or entitlement to compensation.  


G. 23 Exit Strategy/Off Ramp at the Option Period and 

          Re-certification


The contracts have an exit strategy built in at the option period. Contract holders must have amassed at least $500K in orders on their contract to be eligible for the option period. If the contract holder does not achieve at least $500K in orders during the base period, the Government simply will not exercise the option.


Prior to exercising the option period, the contractor will be required to re-certify business size status. The Government will use ORCA (discussed in Section K) as it did originally for the contract awards. If a previously awarded small business concern re-represents itself as other than small, the PCO is precluded from exercising the option.


If SBA issues an interim final rule, or final rule, requiring an alternate small business concern size recertification regime, GSA will follow it.



G. 24 SUBCONTRACTORS


The Government has not pre-approved any subcontractors in making contract awards, and will only do so on a task order, by task order, basis – which falls upon the OCO to complete. Consistent with the terms of the Contract (see, for instance, the flow down requirement of FAR 52.222-11 & Government consent requirement and terms of 52.244-2), no Government (PCO or OCO) consent is required for subcontractors under Fixed-Price (FP) order terms for subcontractors that the contractor has provided a completed standard form 1413 on and deemed responsible pursuant to FAR 9.104-4 and the responsibility standards in FAR 9.1. This is a significant reason for OCOs to embrace FP task order terms! Contractors shall provide written evidence of that responsibility determination to the OCO upon request as a prerequisite to subcontractor inclusion in task order performance. Government consent is required of subcontractors under other than FP order terms, as is the information required in FAR 52.222-11 and 52.244-2 unless the contractor has an approved purchasing system; if a contractor has an approved purchasing system pursuant to FAR 52.244-2, that preapproval requirement is considered met. Completed standard form 1413 and responsibility determinations may still be required in writing by OCO’s as a prerequisite to subcontractor inclusion in task order performance.


G. 25  End of Contract Reporting


Summary reports are required of each Contract awardee at the end of their Contract. Those reports must include a list of all Orders issued to the contractor under the Contract and their associated: Government Order numbers, client agency names, total dollar values, periods of performance, subcontracting percentages and the CAF amounts paid to the Government.   


�
SECTION H �SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS 

H.1 OVERALL CONTRACT MAXIMUM AMOUNT 
There is a Program maximum (GWAC ceiling) of $5 billion competitively available to all contract holders over the life of all Contracts. As an Order is issued against a Contract, the value of Orders that can be issued under all Contracts decreases the GWAC ceiling available balance by an equal amount. 

H.2 OVERALL CONTRACT MINIMUM AMOUNT (GUARANTEE)  
The GWAC ceiling IS NOT the minimum guarantee detailed in Section B. The Contractor and Government agree that, given the totality of intent and consideration proposed by the parties evidenced by the facts and circumstances, and given that the minimum guarantee accurately represents to volume of work certain to be ordered, the minimum guarantee is adequate consideration to establish a binding indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity Contract for the purpose intended by the solicitation. A request for payout of the minimum guarantee balance unmet through orders must be submitted in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) no more than 30 calendar days after the Contract Ordering Period detailed in Section F. Failure to submit the written demand to the PCO within that time period results in forfeiture of entitlement to any minimum guarantee balance unmet through orders. 

H.3 OPEN SEASONS
GSA intends to consider an on-ramp/open-season at the option period if it is deemed to be in the Government’s best interest. Contracts awarded under open-season authority will share the GWAC ceiling remaining and their award shall not constitute a basis for Contractual adjustment for existing Contract holders. Solicitations and any resulting Contracts awarded under this authority will closely parallel the originals, and will not exceed their remaining duration. A successor GWAC, e.g. a 2nd generation GWAC for the same work scope, isn’t constrained by the current GWAC’s ceiling. 

H.4 ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO THE CONTRACT 
Contractors are hereby advised that a conforming (up to date through all amendments, if any) copy of the contract including all modifications, and also including prices for the base period and option period, if exercised, shall be made available on the VETS website for public viewing. Awarded line item pricing is deemed to be public data. 

H.5 INDUSTRY PARTNER WEBPAGE 
It is a material contract requirement that, for the life of their Contract(s), each Contractor shall design, deploy, operate, maintain, update and manage a 24x7 Section 508 compliant informational web page (or pages) with a static URL that can be linked to

�
 externally solely featuring this GWAC contract(s). The purpose of the webpage is for the Industry Partner to communicate with potential customers regarding the Industry Partner’s ability to provide world-class information technology services under the GWAC. The webpage should demonstrate the functional capability associated with different products or business areas awarded under the GWAC. Each Contractor shall provide a prominent hyperlink to the aforementioned web page on their internet home page, after splash screen type introductions - if any, with no scroll down necessary to view the link. The webpage should be easily accessible from the Industry Partner’s front page and intuitive for novice computer users. This webpage at minimum must include the following items: 

(1) A conforming version of the contract; 

(2) A list of all team members proposed and their capability/area of expertise; 

(3) A description of the functional area services awarded under the GWAC 

(4) A description of the Industry Partner’s quality assurance program; 

(5) GSA’s Ordering Guide for the GWAC; 

(6) Corporate points of contact 

(7) A prominent link to the GSA Small Business GWAC Center GWAC website 


The specific taxonomy and look/feel/aesthetics of the web content remains at the discretion of the Contractor. The web site content shall be deployed and operational within 30 calendar days of Contract award. 

H.6 PERFORMANCE-BASED SERVICES CONTRACTING (PBSC) 
Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 37.6, performance-based contracting techniques will be applied to Task Orders issued under this contract to the maximum extent practicable. 

H.7 PHASE OUT OF CONTRACT AND CONTINUITY OF TASK ORDER SERVICES 
Phase out of contract and continuity of services will be individually addressed under each Task Order if applicable. 

H.8 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
See Section C.5. When applicable, the Contractor shall comply with the Computer Security Act of 1987 and the Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information (DoD 5220.22-M). 

The Industry Partner facility that processes personnel security clearances or data must possess Top Secret facility clearance. Individual task requests shall specify the level of security clearance that will be required for assigned Industry Partner personnel.  The Industry Partner is responsible for providing properly cleared personnel, providing security briefings, and ensuring compliance by its employees with the Government or 

�
Industry Partner security regulations. This includes the safekeeping, wearing, and visibility of an Industry Partner provided picture name badge, and any special agency badges.  The Industry Partner shall ensure the return of all badges, and any other Government property, upon task completion, or when personnel depart a task permanently or for an extended period of time.


Industry Partner management and Task Order personnel shall have a clearance commensurate with the Task Orders they support.  Clearances, primarily Top Secret, may require Special Background Investigations (SBI) leading to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access or Special Access Programs (SAP).  The Industry Partner may be required to obtain agency-specific access, such as a Q clearance or clearance for restricted data.  Other checks and investigations may be required to verify the Industry Partner employee's trustworthiness and suitability for the position.  The Industry Partner shall cooperate with, and furnish information and completed forms to the Task Order client representative or GSA, when required, for the purpose of any special security checks or processing required by the agency, particularly for sensitive positions that require a National Agency Check (NAC), National Agency Check Investigation (NACI), credit check, police/FBI records check, or background investigation.  Clearances and checks may be required at the start of Task Order work.


All clearances, checks, research, and associated activities shall be at Industry Partner expense, and shall not result in any direct cost to the Government.


H.9	LIABILTY


H.9.1  RESERVED


H.9.2 Government Liability


The Government shall not be liable for any injury to the Contractor's personnel or damage to the Contractor's property unless such injury or damage is due to negligence or intentional misconduct on the part of the Government and is recoverable under the Federal Torts Claims Act, or pursuant to another Federal statutory authority.

�
H.10	INSURANCE


Insurance Schedule --


This schedule is in connection with 52.228-5 and 552.228-70 found in Section I.


Workman's compensation insurance required by law of the State where performance is conducted.


Comprehensive bodily injury insurance with limits of not less than $500,000 for each occurrence.


Property Damage liability with a limit of not less than $100,000 for each occurrence.


Automotive bodily injury liability insurance with limits of not less than $200,000 for each person and $500,000 for each occurrence, and property damage liability insurance with a limit of not less than $50,000 for each occurrence.


Prior to the commencement of work hereunder, the Industry Partner shall furnish to the PCO and any OCO requesting it a certificate or written statement of the above required insurance.  The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the interests of the Government shall not be effective (1) for such period as the laws of the State in which this contact is to be performed prescribe, or (2) until thirty (30) days after the insurer or the Industry Partner gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.


The Industry Partner agrees to insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a Government installation.  The subcontractor(s), will be obligated by the prime contractor, to provide and maintain the insurance required by the virtue of this contract.  At least five (5) days before entry of each such subcontractor's personnel on a Government installation, the Industry Partner shall furnish (or ensure that there has been furnished) to the PCO and OCO, a current certificate of insurance, meeting the requirements of the above paragraphs.


H.11 DEDUCTIBLES UNDER REQUIRED INSURANCE COVERAGE & COST


The following requirements also apply to this contract:


The Industry Partner is required to present evidence of the amount of any deductibles in its insurance coverage.

�

For any insurance required the Industry Partner’s deductible is not allowable as a direct or indirect cost under this contract. The Government is not liable, and cannot be invoiced, for any losses up to the minimum amounts of coverage required in subsections (a) through (d) above. If the Industry Partner obtains an insurance policy with deductibles, the Industry Partner, and not the Government, is responsible for any deductible amount up to the minimum amounts of coverage stated.


If the Industry Partner fails to follow all procedures stated in this subsection and in FAR 52.228-7(g), any amounts above the amount of the obtained insurance coverage which are not covered by insurance will not be reimbursable under the contract. 


The maximum reimbursement for insurance allowable is the Contract minimum guarantee.


H.12 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST


The guidelines and procedures of FAR Subpart 9.5 will be used in identifying and resolving any issues of organizational conflict of interest.


In the event that Task Orders issued under this contract require the Industry Partner to gain access to proprietary information of other companies, the Industry Partner shall be required to execute agreements with those companies to protect the information from unauthorized use and to refrain from using it for any purpose other than for which it was furnished.


H.13 CONFLICT OF INTEREST MITIGATION PLAN


In the event that a Task Order (TO) is issued to the Industry Partner that would require activity that would create a potential conflict of interest, the Industry Partner shall:


Notify the PCO and OCO of a potential conflict, and;


Recommend to the Government an alternate tasking approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or


Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:


Describe in detail the TO requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and


Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Industry Partner in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.


The Industry Partner shall not commence work on a TO related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the PCO and OCO to proceed.

�

If the PCO and OCO determine that it is in the best interest of the Government to issue a TO, withstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver shall be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.


H.14 LIMITED USE OF DATA INFORMATION


In the performance of services under this contract, the Industry Partner may be required to perform operations on, have access to, or handle data and information that contain classified, sensitive, proprietary, or privacy information or data.  The Industry Partner shall be responsible for safeguarding the information and data while under the control of or available to the Industry Partner, and to prevent it from being compromised, altered, damaged, lost, or improperly disseminated.  The CO may require Industry Partner personnel on a particular Task Order to sign "no conflict of interest" and "non-disclosure" statements as a requirement for assignment to a task.  Industry Partner personnel who sign such statements shall be briefed on the meaning and restrictions associated with "conflict of interest" and "non-disclosure".


Industry Partner personnel shall not divulge or release privacy data or information developed or obtained in the performance of this contract, until made public or specifically authorized by the Government.  Classified information will be handled in accordance with the provided DD254.  The Industry Partner shall not use, disclose or reproduce third party companies’ proprietary data, other than as authorized and required in the performance of this contract.


Data, information, or knowledge obtained as a result of working on a Task Order, may fall into special categories, many of which are indicated above, or may have special client sensitivity.  Industry Partner employees working on a Task Order may not know the sensitivity of data, information, or situations observed, therefore, it is best to consider all information obtained on a task as sensitive.  The Industry Partner shall ensure that task personnel receive special briefings as required by Government regulations and procedures, and include for all task personnel, briefings on the sensitivity of operations, data, and information on any task, and their responsibility for safeguarding and avoiding unauthorized dissemination of any information obtained as a result of performance on a Task Order.  


The limitations noted in the preceding paragraphs do not apply to data or information that has been made public by the Government.  Further, this provision does not preclude the use of any data independently acquired by the Industry Partner without such limitations, or prohibit an agreement, at no cost to the Government, between the Industry Partner and the data owner that provides for greater rights to the Industry Partner.

H.15	RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

�

The Industry Partner and its employees shall conduct business covered by this contract only during periods paid for by the Government and shall not conduct any other business on Government premises.  The Industry Partner shall not use Government materials except for the express purpose of providing Government support under the contract. The Industry Partner shall not provide assistance to client personnel in developing client requirements except as directed in performance of task duties by the OCO and order statement of work.  If requested by the client to provide such non-task related assistance, the Industry Partner shall immediately contact the OCO and PCO to preclude the possibility of conflicts of interest. If the Industry Partner is required to prepare or assist in the preparation of a SOW to be used in a competitive procurement, GSA or any customer will not consider the Industry Partner, its successor-in-interest, assignee, nor affiliates a prime source of supply for, nor allow it to be a subcontractor or consultant to the competitive procurement.

Should Government-furnished programming aids or software packages not be suitable for their intended use on the system(s) for which designed, except where such property is furnished "as is," the Industry Partner shall notify the CONTRACTING OFFICER REPRESENTATIVE and supply documentation regarding any defects and their effect on progress under this contract or resulting Task Order.  The OCO will consider equitably adjusting the performance dates or Task Order value, or both, and any other contractual provision affected by the Government-furnished property in accordance with the procedures provided for in the “Changes” clause in Section I of this contract.

H.26 INDUSTRY PARTNERS COMMITMENTS, WARRANTIES, AND REPRESENTATIONS


Any written commitments by the Industry Partner within the scope of this contract shall be binding and shall render the Industry Partner liable for damage to the Government under the terms of this contract.  A written commitment by the Industry Partner shall be limited to the proposal submitted by the Industry Partner and to specific written modifications, further defined as including: 


Any warranty or representation made by the Industry Partner in a proposal as to software, systems performance, and other physical design or functioning characteristics of a component or system.


Warranties or representations made by the Industry Partner concerning the characteristics of items, made in any literature, descriptions or specifications accompanying or referred to in a proposal. 

Written modification, affirmation, or representation as to the above which is made by the Industry Partner in or during the course of negotiations, whether or not incorporated formally into the proposal.


H.27 TECHNICAL REFRESHMENT 


After contract award, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) may, pursuant to the FAR Clause 52.243-1, Changes – Fixed Price, Alternate II or FAR Clause 52.243-3, Changes – Time and Materials or Labor Hours, order changes within the scope of the contract to benefit all industry partners, and not a single or subset of industry partners.  These changes may be required to improve performance, or react to changes in technology.

The Government may solicit, and the Industry Partner is encouraged to propose independently, improvements to the services, features, or other requirements of the Contract.  These improvements may be proposed to save money, to improve performance, or for any other purpose which presents a service advantage to the Government.  Those proposed service improvements that are acceptable to the PCO will be processed as modifications to the Contract.


As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the Industry Partner with each proposal:


A description of the difference between the existing Contract and the proposed change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each;


Itemized requirements of the Contract which must be changed if the proposal is adopted, and the proposed revision to the Contract for each such change;


An estimate of the changes in performance and cost, if any, that will result from adoption of the proposal;


An evaluation of the effects that the proposed changes would have on collateral costs to the Government, such as Government-furnished property costs, costs of related items, and costs of maintenance, operation, and conversion (including Government-premise equipment); 


Any effect on the Contract or TO completion time or delivery schedule shall be identified.


The Government will not be liable for proposal preparation costs or any delay in acting upon any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause.  The Industry Partner has the right to withdraw, in whole or in part, any proposal not accepted by the Government within the period specified in the proposal.  The decision of the PCO as to the acceptance of any such proposal under this Contract is final and not subject to the "Disputes" clause of this Contract.


The PCO may accept any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause by giving the Industry Partner written notice thereof. Such changes are intended to benefit the entire industry partner pool, and not a single one, so only engage this process if you want your suggested improvement to be shared in that way, both as a discussion item and as a potential contract modification. This written notice will be given by issuance of a modification to the Contract or TO.  Unless and until a modification is executed to incorporate a proposal under the Contract or TO, the Industry Partner shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the requirements, terms, and conditions of the existing Contract or TO.


If a proposal submitted pursuant to this clause is accepted and applied to this Contract or TO issued hereunder, the equitable adjustment increasing or decreasing the Contract or TO price shall be in accordance with the procedures of the "Changes" clause.  The resulting Contract modification will state that it is made pursuant to this clause.
H.28 ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION


Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedure increases the opportunity for relatively inexpensive and expeditious resolution of issues in controversy.  These procedures may be used by the Government any time that the Contracting Officer has authority to resolve the issue in controversy.  If the Contractor submits a claim, the Contracting Officer may apply ADR procedures to all or part of the claim.  Contractor claims must be certified in accordance with FAR 33.207.  When ADR procedures are used after the issuance of a Contracting Officer's final decision, the time limitations or procedural requirements for filing an appeal of the Contracting Officer's final decision are not altered.


H.29	AGENCY-SPECIFIC CLAUSES

Provisions and clauses that supplement the FAR, which are prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations and issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole may be added at the Task Order level so long as they are not inconsistent with the terms of this contract and do not exceed its scope.  


Provisions and clauses that supplement the FAR are described as follows:


(a)	Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole; 

(b)	Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a sub organization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular sub organization; or 

(c)	Developed for use at a sub organizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or sub organization acquisition regulation. 


H.30 REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973


Goods and services delivered under this contract shall meet the applicable technical provisions of the Access Board found at 36 CFR 1194, parts B, C and D or provide equivalent facilitation and other requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as applicable.

H.31 Supervision of Employees							


The Contractor's employees and subcontractor's employees of any tier shall remain under the Contractor's direct supervision at all times.  Although the Government will coordinate with the Contractor within the scope of the Contract, detailed day-to-day instruction and supervision for the Contractor's and subcontractor's employees shall remain the responsibility of the Contractor. This is not a personal services Contract. The contract and task orders do not establish privity of contract with subcontractors.


H.32 Documentation


The Contractor shall provide complete sets of operator, programmer, software system, utility, installation, and user manuals.  The Contractor shall also provide other necessary documentation for all hardware and software delivered under this Contract in accordance with product line documentation standards,


All provided documentation shall be available either electronically or in hardcopy.  Electronic documentation must be fully viewable via Adobe Acrobat Reader™, MS-Word™ or a furnished graphical user interface (with a full license to the GUI interface conveying to the Government) having intelligent search capabilities and must be easily printable from stand-alone and networked Hewlett Packard™ type printers.


It is desirable that documentation is available in both electronic and hardcopy formats.

Hardware Documentation shall include --

Reference manuals detailing all elements and operations of all delivered language processors, text editors, I/O handlers, operating system, system generation, system architecture, software tools and utilities, configuration management, and performance measurement software 

Reference manuals detailing command language, communication software, input/output system, error handling, and diagnostic software 

Computer reference and system programmer manuals detailing every machine instruction and all programming considerations 

Problem determination and debugging guides 

A guide to writing device drivers 

Documentation of known problems and/or suspected system errors 

Introductory manuals for new users to the operating system and computer system environment 

An on-line introductory tutorial for new users 

Other Manuals 
The Contractor may include any other manuals and program information it considered useful. 

H.33 SPECIAL PERSONNEL SKILLS 
Special personnel skills are those for which the expertise required or duties performed for task orders are within the contract scope, but are so specialized or rare that they are not explicitly defined in a skill category description.  The PCO will determine whether circumstances warrant use of this special skill category.  Based on price or cost analysis, the PCO will negotiate a fair and reasonable labor rate (market rate) with the Contractor for the special personnel skill on a task-by-task basis. 

H.34 OTHER DIRECT COSTS 
"VETS is a “Solutions Contract” encompassing pre-established fully burdened labor line items and four additional line items (four line items) introduced in Section B, those being: 

· Supplies · Travel · Incidental Construction · Other Direct Costs (i.e., additional skill categories) 

Three of the four (all except travel) line items are explicitly required to be fixed price items/fully definitized up front in every order. Travel has adequate controls on base cost 

(this is a term established in Section B) in the applicable travel regulation options to permit it to not be fully definitized up front in each task order, but it shall at least be monetarily capped in each order. 

With the flexibility to have the four line items in task orders and to receiving handling compensation for them comes the added responsibility on the awardees and the Government of ensuring the value of pre-competing their ceiling handling rates is carried forward into task orders. This is accomplished by showing the applied handling rate for each of the four items in quotes or proposals for task order work and by the Ordering Contracting Officer (defined in Section G) making sure that base costs plus applied handling rates (capped at the ceiling rates) are fair and reasonable. In determining that the four additional items are ultimately fair and reasonable, the Government may use a range of techniques including price analysis, and other than cost or pricing data from the contract holder in the form of the breakdown of the base cost + the applied handling rate. 

Since the ceiling handling rate is competed up front and certain, the offeror shall demonstrate its application (at the ceiling or less) at the order level/when pricing task order opportunities. If the offeror doesn’t show the application of the handling rate (at the ceiling or less) in its pricing of the four line items, then the Government does not have adequate assurance it is being applied properly/that it is receiving the benefits of the predetermined ceiling handling rates – something it must receive. The requirement for full base cost and handling rate breakdown in quotes or proposals for task order work, and ultimate definitization as fixed price items in issued task orders (except for travel) is an absolute standard. Failing that, supplies, incidental construction and other direct costs are not permitted under the Contract. 

VETS terms and conditions apply to the four line items. It is essential that the use of any of those four line items be deemed by the ordering contracting officer as within the overall scope of the services based contract, bearing in mind the particulars of the applicable task order’s requirements, or they shall not be included in a task order.  

The predominant work in terms of total dollar value for each task order shall consist of services from the pre-established labor category line items. The four line items must be related to the provision of services that are within contract scope and are not separately orderable. No order may ever consist solely of one or more of the four additional line items. 

While hardware and/or software are permitted to come in as supplies under task orders, they must be subordinate to a services-based solution for each task order they are included on.

SECTION I


CONTRACT CLAUSES


I.1	GENERAL 


The Ordering Agency may include additional contract clauses in orders, other than those enumerated in this section, such as (1) optional FAR clauses, (2) agency clauses, (3) unmentioned FAR alternate clauses, and (4) order specific clauses.  


Some orders may have work containing a combination of contract types, i.e., fixed-price (FP), time & materials (T&M), and labor-hour (LH) terms. The ordering Agency is responsible for identifying the applicable order type(s), which must be stated in the order.  


VETS GWAC accommodates orders with the following terms: fixed-price (all in FAR 16.2), time-and-materials (per FAR 16.6), and labor-hour (per FAR 16.6). VETS GWAC will also allow requiring activities to choose among the incentive features found in FAR 16.4 that are tied to fixed-price, time-and-materials, and labor-hour terms. Incentive features must be fully expounded in RFQs or RFPs for order opportunities and resulting orders.


The clauses listed in the following table primarily consist of those listed in the FAR Matrix (at FAR 52.301) as “R”, meaning “Required” and those that are “A”, meaning “Required when applicable”. Clause applicability is determined by FAR prescription for use, which turns on the facts of the order. Where alternate clauses and/or portions of clauses are listed, FAR prescription for use controls their applicability in orders.  


Although all clause selections are important, ordering contracting officers should pay special attention to the selection and identification of clauses beginning with “52.227” in order RFQs/RFPs as selection amongst highly significant mutually exclusive options is required. This discretion requires the highest standard of requirement recognition and deliberation by the ordering contracting officer. Ordering contracting officers will need to specifically identify the applicable clauses beginning with “52.227” in each RFQ/RFP.  The convention adopted in this contract for order competition regarding clauses beginning with “52.227” is that those clauses listed in RFQs/RFPs for orders apply, while those that are not cited, don’t apply.  A failure to mention any clauses beginning with “52.227” in an RFQ/RFP renders that RFQ/RFP defective until that matter is cured by the ordering contracting officer, so such matters should be brought to their attention immediately.


Ordering contracting officers will also need to select between 52.233-1 and 52.233-1 Alternate I in order RFQs/RFPs.  The convention adopted in this contract for order competition regards 52.233-1 and 52.233-1 Alternate I is that the one listed in RFQs/RFPs for orders apply, while those that are not cited, don’t apply.  A failure to mention which of those two options applies renders that RFQ/RFP defective until that matter is cured by the ordering contracting officer, so such matters should be brought to their attention immediately.

High value end items procured as part of a services order may require additional clauses such as those mentioned in FAR 46.805(5). While Clause 52.246-25 is already part of this contract, related clauses may also be specifically written into order RFQs/RFPs.

(a) The Government may extend the term of the contract by written notice to the contractor within 30 days of the expiration of the contract provided, that the Government shall give the contractor a preliminary notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.


(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option provision.


(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of options under this clause, shall not exceed ten year Contract Ordering Period, as discussed in Section F, paragraph F.3 TERM OF CONTRACT AND ORDERS.


I.7 552.217-71  Notice Regarding Option(s)  (NOV 1992) 


The General Services Administration (GSA) has included an option to extend the term of this contract in order to demonstrate the value it places on quality performance by providing a mechanism for continuing a contractual relationship with a successful Offeror that performs at a level which meets or exceeds GSA’s quality performance expectations as communicated to the Contractor, in writing, by the Contracting Officer or designated representative. When deciding whether to exercise the option, the Contracting Officer will consider the quality of the Contractor’s past performance under this contract in accordance with 48 CFR 517.207. 


I.8  RESERVED


I.9  GSAM 552.252-6 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (SEPT 1999)


(a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation or variation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" or "(VARIATION)" after the date of the clause, if the clause is not published in the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 5).  The use in this solicitation of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause with an authorized deviation or variation that is published in the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION (FAR clause no.))" or "(VARIATION (FAR clause no.))" after the date of the clause.


(b) The use in this solicitation of any General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation clause with an authorized deviation or variation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" or "(VARIATION)" after the date of the clause.


(c) Changes in wording of clauses that are prescribed for use on a "substantially the same as" basis are not considered deviations.  Therefore, when such clauses are not worded exactly the same as the FAR or GSAM clause, they are identified by the word "(VARIATION)".

I.10 Government Facility Access & Availability


FAR provision 52.237-1 Site Visit (Apr 1984) applies to each and every RFQ/RFP and Order issued regardless if it is cited there or not (it is a provision, and it usually applies only at the solicitation level, but it also applies to RFQ's/RFP and Orders under this Contract too.) Contractors uncertain of conditions for performance are instructed to inquire regarding, but no limited to, the means of premises ingress/egress, security requirements, delivery/demurrage, storage, use of approaches, use of corridors, use of stairways, use of elevators, Government furnished space/property/equipment, availability of/access to Government facilities on federal holidays, and similar matters prior to submission of a quotation or request for proposal for task order opportunities. 

During all operations on Government premises, the Contractor's personnel shall comply with the rules and regulations governing the conduct of personnel and the operation of the facility.
