1 Introduction 

1.1 Purpose 
This document will discuss the configuration to eliminate the Access Manager 
double prompting issue when Upfront and IBM Cognos Planning are installed in 
a distributed environment. 

1.2 Applicability 
MS Windows OS 2000, XP, or 2003. 

1.3 Exclusions and Exceptions 
If Upfront and IBM Cognos Planning are installed on the same server then 
this is not applicable. 
 

2 Troubleshooting 

Problem: Upfront will not pass a ticket (or cookie) outside of its stated domain.   
Unless the machines on the LAN have fully qualified names, there is no way for 
Upfront to know that the ticket transfer is allowed.   The following instructions 
are to guide the administrators on how to fully qualify the machine names within 
the scope of IBM Cognos products. 

 
Fully qualified names are usually defined as “machinename.xxxxx.xxx”.  In the 
case of IBM Cognos machines, a fully qualified name would be… 
“servername.cognos.com”. 

3 Solution 

The instructions below are based on the following configuration: 
- Upfront is on machine ‘A’ 
- Access manager is on machine ‘B’ 
- IBM Cognos Planning Contributor is on machine ‘B’

4. Edit the Upfront Server Group & Upfront File Manager Server Group 
properties, to use fully qualified computer names in the Gateway 
URL.  To avoid potential issues elsewhere, make certain that all 
machine references in Configuration manager use Fully Qualified 
names.

5. Edit Access Manager Runtime properties to insure that both 

machines reference the same LDAP server 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 6. From the Contributor Admin Console run the Publish to IBM sCognos 
Portal Admin Extension to create the link in Upfront to your Contributor 
Application.  This step can also be performed manually through Upfront.
