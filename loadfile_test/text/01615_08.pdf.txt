This Agreement will provide protection for information to be
exchanged between us which we do not wish to become public
(“Information”) while maintaining our ability to conduct our
respective business activities.  Each of us agrees that the
following terms shall apply when one of us (“Discloser”) discloses
information to the other (“Recipient”) under this Agreement.

1.  Disclosure.  Each time one of us wishes to disclose specific
Information to the other, or wishes to engage in multiple
disclosures relating to a specific subject matter, Discloser will
issue a supplement to this Agreement (“Supplement”) before
disclosure.  The Supplement will contain initial and final
disclosure dates, and a non-confidential description of the
Information to be disclosed.  The Supplement must be signed by
the Discloser and the Recipient.

Information may be disclosed by: (i) presentation; (ii) delivery; (iii)
authorized access, such as to a data base; or (iv) any other
express means.  Information must be identified as confidential at
the time of disclosure, and all materials containing Information
must have a restrictive marking.  The Discloser shall not disclose
any information not described in a signed Supplement or which
Discloser does not have the right to disclose to the Recipient.

Disclosure may take place through the Discloser or its Related
Companies.  A Related Company is any corporation, company, or
other entity which: (i) is Controlled by a party hereto; (ii) Controls
a party hereto; (iii) is under common Control with a party hereto.
For this purpose, “Control” means that more than fifty percent
(50%) of the controlled entity’s shares or ownership interest
representing the right to make decisions for such entity are owned
or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the controlling entity.  An
entity is considered to be a Related Company only so long as
such ownership or control exists.

2. Protection.  For two (2)  years after the date of disclosure, the
Recipient will use the same care and discretion to avoid
disclosure of the Discloser’s Information as the Recipient uses
with its own similar Information which it does not wish to disclose.
Subject to this obligation, the Recipient may use Discloser’s
Information for any purpose.

3. Exceptions.  The Recipient may disclose Discloser’s
Information to: (i) its employees and contractors, and employees
and contractors of its Related Companies, who have a need to
know; and (ii) any other party with the Discloser’s prior written
consent.  USC may disclose Discloser’s Information to IBM and
its employees, contractors, and employees and contractors of its

Related Companies, who have a need to know.  Prior to any such
disclosure, the Recipient must have an appropriate agreement
with any such party sufficient to require the party to treat
Information in accordance with this Agreement.

The Recipient may disclose Information to the extent required by 
law, but must give the Discloser reasonable prior notice to allow
the Discloser an opportunity to obtain a protective order.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligation shall apply to
Information that is: (i) already rightfully in the Recipient’s
possession or rightfully received by the Recipient without a
nondisclosure obligation; (ii) developed independently by the

Recipient; (iii) publicly available when received, or thereafter
becomes publicly available through no fault of the Recipient; (iv)
disclosed by the Discloser without a signed Supplement as
required by Section 1; (v) disclosed by the Discloser to a third
party without a nondisclosure obligation; or (vi) inherently
disclosed by the Recipient in the use, distribution or marketing of
any product or service.

4.  Disclaimers.  THE DISCLOSER PROVIDES INFORMATION
SOLELY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS.

Neither this Agreement, nor any disclosure of Information
hereunder, in any way: (i) grants to either of us any right or
license under any copyright, patent, mask work or trademark now
or hereafter owned or controlled by the other; (ii) obligates either
of us to disclose or receive any Information, perform any work,
enter into any license, business engagement or other agreement;  
(iii) limits either of us from developing, manufacturing or
marketing products or services which may be competitive with
those of the other; (iv) limits either of us from assigning or
reassigning its employees in any way; (v) creates any joint
relationship or authorizes either of us to act or speak on behalf of
the other; or (vi) limits either of us from entering into any
business relationship with any other parties.

5.  General.  Neither of us may assign or otherwise transfer our
rights or delegate our duties or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other.  Any attempt to do
so will be void. The Recipient must comply with all applicable
United States and foreign export laws and regulations. Only a
written agreement signed by both of us can modify this
Agreement. Either of us may terminate this Agreement by
providing one month’s written notice to the other.  Any provisions
of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond its
termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to our
respective successors and authorized assigns. If there is a
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a Supplement,
those of the Supplement will prevail. This Agreement will be
governed by the substantive law of the State of New York.
Discloser and Recipient may communicate with each other by
facsimile and such communication is acceptable as a writing.
The autographs of representatives of Discloser and Recipient, as
received by facsimile machine, shall constitute “original”
signatures.  Any reproduction of this Agreement by reliable
means will be considered an original of this Agreement.  This
Agreement, including any Supplements, is the complete and
exclusive agreement regarding our disclosures hereunder.
