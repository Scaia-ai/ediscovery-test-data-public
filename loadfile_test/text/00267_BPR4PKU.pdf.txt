Example from Ford motor company

 Prior to BPR
– At ford, the Accounts Payable department 

was tediously slow largely because it relied 
upon multiple copies of paper to flow back 

and forth among the purchasing agent, the 
vendor, the receiving dock, and the accounts 
payable clerk. 

 After BPR
– A change in the process flow substituted 

automatic computer telecommunications for 
the paper copies of the bill of lading, 
purchase order, and invoice. With the 

eradication of each of these pieces of paper 
came the elimination of the time and labor to 
type, mail, open, read, and respond to them.

 Concrete Results 
– Check items: 14 pieces Æ 3 pieces

– Human resource: 500 people Æ 125 people
– Performing cycle: 2 weeks Æ 2 hours

Example form IBM Credit Corporation

 Prior to reengineering, it took IBM 
Credit from 6 days to two weeks to 
issue credit. Often they would lose 
customers during the lengthy 
approval process.

 Today, the process takes only 
minutes or hours.

–Now instead of sending an 
application from office to office, one 
person called a deal structurer, 
processes the entire application from 
beginning to end

–Decision support systems is 
developed for the deal structurer to 
guide them through the credit 

issuance process

What is Business Process Reengineering (BPR)

 BPR was first introduced to the business world by Frederick Taylor 
when he published his article The Principles of Scientific Management

in the 1900s.

 The Scientific Management method gave birth to Total Quality 
Management in Japan after World War II, whose main goal is to 
improve the manufacturing operations.

 In the 1990s, Michael Hammer and James Champy introduced their 
book Reengineering the Corporation, which gave birth to the term 

Business Process Reengineering
– The fundamental rethinking and radically redesign of business 

processes to achieve dramatic improvement in critical, contemporary 
measures of performance such as  cost, quality, service and speed.

– The implementation of deliberate and fundamental change in business 
processes to achieve breakthrough improvements in performance.

– Enabled by IT

Key target categories of BPR (Davenport)

 Business Process Redesign can be defined as “the analysis and design of 
workflow and processes within and between organizations” (Davenport & 
Short, 1990). BPR has three key target categories:

– Customer Friendly

– One of the main goals of introducing BPR is to get a competitive edge which can 
only be gained by providing the customers more than the others in the market. 

– Effectiveness

– How effective is the product or service provided by the company to the customer?
– If the provided product or service is successful, then the customers would 

automatically want to buy that product or service again. 
– Efficiency

– How efficient is the company that is manufacturing the product before introducing it 
to the market to maximize costs? 

– That is believed to be more important than any others. If a manufacturing company 
can master the skill of being efficient then they can automatically be more customer 
friendly and effective. 

– Efficiency is not just about being efficient at the production floor level but the 
management level also has to be efficient.

Seven principles of BPR (Hammer & Champy)

 Hammer and Champy felt that the design of workflow in most large corporations 
was based on assumptions about technology, people, and organizational 
goals that were no longer valid. They suggested seven principles of 
reengineering to streamline the work process and thereby achieve significant 
levels of improvement in quality, time management, and cost: 

– Organize around outcomes, not tasks.

– Identify all the processes in an organization and prioritize them in order of redesign 
urgency.

– Integrate information processing work into the real work that produces the 
information.

– Treat geographically dispersed resources as though they were centralized.

– Link parallel activities in the workflow instead of just integrating their results.

– Put the decision point where the work is performed, and build control into the 
process.

– Capture information once and at the source.

Davenport five-step approach to BPR

 Develop the Business Vision and Process Objectives: BPR is driven by a 
business vision which implies specific business objectives such as Cost 
Reduction, Time Reduction, Output Quality improvement,

 Identify the Processes to be Redesigned: Most firms use the High- Impact 
approach which focuses on the most important processes or those that 
conflict most with the business vision. Lesser number of firms use the 

Exhaustive approach that attempts to identify all the processes within an 
organization and then prioritize them in order of redesign urgency. 

 Understand and Measure the Existing Processes: For avoiding the 
repeating of old mistakes and for providing a baseline for future 

improvements. 
 Identify IT Levers: Awareness of IT capabilities can and should influence 

process design. 
 Design and Build a Prototype of the New Process: The actual design 

should not be viewed as the end of the BPR process. Rather, it should be 
viewed as a prototype, with successive iterations. The metaphor of prototype 
aligns the BPR approach with quick delivery of results, and the involvement 
and satisfaction of customers.

Business Assess 
--from IBM Global Method

 The purpose of the Business Assess phase is to understand, assess, and document the 
current and future business and organizational capabilities. This activity will involve 
understanding and assessing the business strategy, critical processes, readiness for 

proposed change and the current IT-infrastructure and application portfolio.

Key enabler of BPR: IT

 Hammer considers IT as the key enabler of BPR which he considers as 
"radical change." 

 Davenport & Short outline the following capabilities that reflect the roles that 
IT can play in BPR: 

– Transactional

– Geographical

– Automatical

– Analytical

– Informational

– Sequential

– Knowledge Management

– Tracking

– Disintermediation. 
 Otherwise, advanced IT technologies might drive the change of business, for 

instance, IBM RFID (Ratio Frequency Identification) Solution for the 
Consumer Driven Supply Chain

Enabling technologies for BPR

 Benchmarking
– Benchmarking: The search for industry best practice that lead to

superior performance 

– Continuous measurement of a process, product, or service compared 
to those of the toughest competitor, to those considered industry 
leaders, or to similar activities in the organization in order to find and 

implement ways to improve it (APICS, the Association for Operations 
Management)

 Key Performance Indicators (KPI), 
– also known as Key Success Indicators (KSI) are financial or non-

financial metrics used to reflect the critical success factors of an 
organization. 

– These are used in Business Intelligence to assess the present state of 
business and to prescribe the course of action

Enabling technologies for BPR (cont.)

 Activity Based Costing
– Activity-based costing (ABC) is a method of allocating costs to 

products and services. It is generally used as a tool for planning and 
control

 Program Evaluation and Review Techniques
– PERT is basically a method for analyzing the tasks involved in 

completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete 
each task, and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the 
total project.



China Research Lab

 Balance Scorecard
– A method for measuring a company's activities in 

terms of its vision and strategies. It gives managers 
a comprehensive view of the performance of a 
business 

 SWOT analysis
– The method of SWOT analysis is to take the 

information from an environmental analysis and 
separate it into internal (strengths and weaknesses) 
and external issues (opportunities and threats). 

– Once this is completed, SWOT analysis determines 
what may assist the firm in accomplishing its 

objectives, and what obstacles must be overcome or 
minimized to achieve desired results

Key findings 

 The need to reduce cost/expense was the most frequently 
cited business driver for reengineering projects with 
competitive pressure, poor customer satisfaction and poor 
quality of products and services rounding out the top-four. 

 The top activity that project teams would do differently on the 
next project is more effective change management. 

 Teams whose projects were driven or heavily supported by 
top management were more likely to complete their project 

at or above expectations. 
 Participants overwhelmingly indicated that the planning 

stage, where scope and roles were set, was the most 
important phase in the project. 

 Resistance to change within the organization was cited six 
times more often than any other as the number one obstacle 
to successful implementation.

Major problems

 The biggest problem that businesses usually face 
with BPR is overzealous expectations. 

– BPR is a business tool with a high price and gradual 
returns. 

– BPR is quoted as having a 30% success rate due to the 
time and cost involved 

 Human constituent of the business process wasn’t 
taken into account.

– "Dr. Hammer points out a flaw: He and the other leaders 
of the $4.7 billion re-engineering industry forgot about 
people”

 BPR is also time sensitive.

From BPR to BPM

 Over the last few years, the reengineering concept has evolved from 
a "radical change" to account for the contextual realism (Caron et. 

al 1994, Earl 1994), and to reconcile with more incremental 
process change methods such as TQM, towards a broader, yet 
more comprehensive process management concept (Davenport 

1995) 
– Quality management, often referred to as total quality management 

(TQM) or continuous improvement, refers to programs and initiatives 
that emphasize incremental improvement in work processes and 

outputs over an open-ended period of time. 

– In contrast, Reengineering, also known as business process redesign 
or process innovation, refers to discrete initiatives that are intended to 
achieve radically redesigned and improved work processes in a 

bounded time frame
