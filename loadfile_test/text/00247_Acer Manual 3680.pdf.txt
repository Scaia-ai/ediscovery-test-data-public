Tips and information for comfortable use
Computer users may complain of eyestrain and headaches after prolonged use. 
Users are also at risk of physical injury after long hours of working in front of a 
computer. Long work periods, bad posture, poor work habits, stress, 
inadequate working conditions, personal health and other factors greatly 
increase the risk of physical injury.

Incorrect computer usage may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, 
tenosynovitis or other musculoskeletal disorders. The following symptoms may 
appear in the hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, neck or back:

 numbness, or a burning or tingling sensation
 aching, soreness or tenderness
 pain, swelling or throbbing
 stiffness or tightness
 coldness or weakness

If you have these symptoms, or any other recurring or persistent discomfort 
and/or pain related to computer use, consult a physician immediately and 
inform your company's health and safety department.

The following section provides tips for more comfortable computer use.

Finding your comfort zone
Find your comfort zone by adjusting the viewing angle of the monitor, using a 
footrest, or raising your sitting height to achieve maximum comfort. Observe 
the following tips:

 refrain from staying too long in one fixed posture
 avoid slouching forward and/or leaning backward
 stand up and walk around regularly to remove the strain on your leg 

muscles
 take short rests to relax your neck and shoulders
 avoid tensing your muscles or shrugging your shoulders
 install the external display, keyboard and mouse properly and within 

comfortable reach
 if you view your monitor more than your documents, place the display at 

the center of your desk to minimize neck strain

Taking care of your vision
Long viewing hours, wearing incorrect glasses or contact lenses, glare, excessive 
room lighting, poorly focused screens, very small typefaces and low-contrast 
displays could stress your eyes. The following sections provide suggestions on 
how to reduce eyestrain.



vii

Eyes
 Rest your eyes frequently.
 Give your eyes regular breaks by looking away from the monitor and 

focusing on a distant point.
 Blink frequently to keep your eyes from drying out.

Display
 Keep your display clean.
 Keep your head at a higher level than the top edge of the display so your 

eyes point downward when looking at the middle of the display. 
 Adjust the display brightness and/or contrast to a comfortable level for 

enhanced text readability and graphics clarity.
 Eliminate glare and reflections by:

 placing your display in such a way that the side faces the window or 
any light source

 minimizing room light by using drapes, shades or blinds
 using a task light
 changing the display's viewing angle
 using a glare-reduction filter
 using a display visor, such as a piece of cardboard extended from the 

display's top front edge
 Avoid adjusting your display to an awkward viewing angle.
 Avoid looking at bright light sources, such as open windows, for extended 

periods of time.

Developing good work habits
Develop the following work habits to make your computer use more relaxing 
and productive:
 Take short breaks regularly and often.
 Perform some stretching exercises.
 Breathe fresh air as often as possible.
 Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy body.

Warning! We do not recommend using the computer on a couch 
or bed. If this is unavoidable, work for only short periods, take 
breaks regularly, and do some stretching exercises.

Note: For more information, please refer to "Regulations and 
safety notices" on page 76 in the AcerSystem User's Guide.

 Acer eDataSecurity Management 
Acer eDataSecurity Management is a handy file encryption utility that protects 
your files from being accessed by unauthorized persons. It is conveniently 
integrated with Windows Explorer as a shell extension for quick and easy data 
encryption/decryption and also supports on-the-fly file encryption for MSN 
Messenger and Microsoft Outlook.

The Acer eDataSecurity Management setup wizard will prompt you for a 
supervisor password and default encryption. This encryption will be used to 
encrypt files by default, or you can choose to enter your own file-specific 
password when encrypting a file.

the system needs to decrypt it. If you lose the password, the 
supervisor password is the only other key capable of decrypting 
the file. If you lose both passwords, there will be no way to 
decrypt your encrypted file! Be sure to safeguard all related 
passwords!

Touchpad
The built-in touchpad is a pointing device that senses movement on its surface. 
This means the cursor responds as you move your finger across the surface of 
the touchpad. The central location on the palmrest provides optimum comfort 
and support.

  Move your finger across the touchpad (2) to move the cursor.

 Press the left (1) and right (4) buttons located beneath the touchpad to 
perform selection and execution functions. These two buttons are similar 
to the left and right buttons on a mouse. Tapping on the touchpad is the 
same as clicking the left button.

 Use the 4-way scroll (3) button to scroll up or down and move left or right 
a page. This button mimics your cursor pressing on the right scroll bar of 
Windows applications.

Note: When using the touchpad, keep it — and your fingers — dry 
and clean. The touchpad is sensitive to finger movement; hence, 
the lighter the touch, the better the response. Tapping harder will 
not increase the touchpad's responsiveness.

Note: By default, vertical and horizontal scrolling is enabled on 
your touchpad. It can be disabled under Mouse settings in 
Windows Control Panel.

Using the keyboard
The keyboard has full-sized keys and an embedded numeric keypad, separate 
cursor, lock, Windows, function and special keys.

Lock keys and embedded numeric keypad
The keyboard has three lock keys which you can toggle on and off.

The embedded numeric keypad functions like a desktop numeric keypad. It is 
indicated by small characters located on the upper right corner of the keycaps. 
To simplify the keyboard legend, cursor-control key symbols are not printed on 
the keys.

Lock key Description

Caps Lock When Caps Lock is on, all alphabetic characters typed are 
in uppercase.

Num Lock 
<Fn> + <F11>

When Num Lock is on, the embedded keypad is in numeric 
mode. The keys function as a calculator (complete with the 
arithmetic operators +, -, *, and /). Use this mode when you 
need to do a lot of numeric data entry. A better solution 
would be to connect an external keypad.

Scroll Lock 
<Fn> + <F12>

When Scroll Lock is on, the screen moves one line up or down 
when you press the up or down arrow keys respectively. 
Scroll Lock does not work with some applications.

Frequently asked questions
The following is a list of possible situations that may arise during the use of 
your computer. Easy solutions are provided for each one.

I turned on the power, but the computer does not start or 
boot up.

Look at the power indicator:

 If it is not lit, no power is being supplied to the computer. Check the 
following:

 If you are using on the battery, it may be low and unable to power 
the computer. Connect the AC adapter to recharge the battery pack.

 Make sure that the AC adapter is properly plugged into the computer 
and to the power outlet.

 If it is lit, check the following:

 Is a non-bootable (non-system) disk in the external USB floppy drive? 
Remove or replace it with a system disk and press <Ctrl> + <Alt> + 
<Del> to restart the system.

Nothing appears on the screen.

The computer's power management system automatically blanks the screen to 
save power. Press any key to turn the display back on.

If pressing a key does not turn the display back on, three things might be 
the cause:

 The brightness level might be too low. Press <Fn> + <→> (increase) to

 Taking your notebook PC with you

This section gives you tips and hints to consider when moving around or 
traveling with your computer.

Disconnecting from the desktop
Follow these steps to disconnect your computer from external accessories:

1 Save any open files.

2 Remove any media, floppy disks or compact disks from the drive(s).

3 Shut down the computer.

4 Close the display cover.

5 Disconnect the cord from the AC adapter.

6 Disconnect the keyboard, pointing device, printer, external monitor and 
other external devices.

7 Disconnect the Kensington lock if you are using one to secure the 
computer.

Moving around
When you are just moving within short distances, for example, from your office 
desk to a meeting room.

Preparing the computer

Before moving the computer, close and latch the display cover to place it in 
Sleep mode. You can now safely take the computer anywhere you go within 
the building. To bring the computer out of Sleep mode, open the display; then 
press and release the power button.

If you are taking the computer to a client's office or a different building, you 
may choose to shut down the computer: 

Click on Start, Turn Off Computer, then click on Turn Off (Windows XP). 

Or:

You can put the computer in Sleep mode by pressing <Fn> + <F4>. Then close 
and latch the display.

When you are ready to use the computer again, unlatch and open the display; 
then press and release the power button.



59

En
glish
Note: If the Sleep indicator is off, the computer has entered Hibernation mode and is turned off. If the power indicator is off 

but the Sleep indicator is on, the computer has entered Sleep 
mode. In both cases, press and release the power button to turn 
the computer back on. Note that the computer may enter 
Hibernation mode after being in Sleep mode for a period of time.

What to bring to meetings

If your meeting is relatively short, you probably do not need to bring anything 
with you other than your computer. If your meeting will be longer, or if your 
battery is not fully charged, you may want to bring the AC adapter with you to 
plug in your computer in the meeting room.

If the meeting room does not have an electrical outlet, reduce the drain on the 
battery by putting the computer in Sleep mode. Press <Fn> + <F4> or close the 
display cover whenever you are not actively using the computer. To resume, 
open the display (if closed), then press and release the power button.

Taking the computer home
When you are moving from your office to your home or vice versa.

Preparing the computer
After disconnecting the computer from your desktop, follow these steps to 
prepare the computer for the trip home:

 Check that you have removed all media and compact disks from the 
drive(s). Failure to remove the media can damage the drive head.

 Pack the computer in a protective case that can prevent the computer from 
sliding around and cushion it if it should fall.

Caution: Avoid packing items next to the top cover of the 
computer. Pressure against the top cover can damage the screen.

What to take with you

Unless you have some items at home, take the following items with you:

 AC adapter and power cord

 The printed User's Guide

 Special considerations

Follow these guidelines to protect your computer while traveling to and 
from work:

 Minimize the effects of temperature changes by keeping the computer 
with you.

 If you need to stop for an extended period of time and cannot carry the 
computer with you, leave the computer in the trunk of the car to avoid 
exposing the computer to excessive heat.

 Changes in temperature and humidity can cause condensation. Allow the 
computer to return to room temperature, and inspect the screen for 
condensation before turning on the computer. If the temperature change 
is greater than 10 °C (18 °F), allow the computer to come to room 
temperature slowly. If possible, leave the computer for 30 minutes in an 
environment with a temperature between outside and room temperature.

Setting up a home office

If you frequently work on your computer at home, you may want to purchase a 
second AC adapter for use at home. With a second AC adapter, you can avoid 
carrying the extra weight to and from home.

If you use your computer at home for significant periods of time, you might also 
want to add an external keyboard, monitor or mouse.

Traveling with the computer
When you are moving within a larger distance, for instance, from your office 
building to a client's office building or traveling locally.

Preparing the computer

Prepare the computer as if you were taking it home. Make sure that the battery 
in the computer is charged. Airport security may require you to turn on your 
computer when carrying it into the gate area.

What to take with you

Take the following items with you:

 AC adapter

 Spare, fully-charged battery pack(s)

 Additional printer driver files if you plan to use another printer



61

En
glish
Special considerations

In addition to the guidelines for taking the computer home, follow these 
guidelines to protect your computer while traveling:

 Always take the computer as carry-on luggage.

 If possible, have the computer inspected by hand. Airport security X-ray 
machines are safe, but do not put the computer through a metal detector.

 Avoid exposing floppy disks to hand-held metal detectors.

Traveling internationally with the computer
When you are moving from country to country.

Preparing the computer

Prepare the computer as you would normally prepare it for traveling.

What to bring with you

Bring the following items with you:

 AC adapter

 Power cords that are appropriate for the country to which you 
are traveling

 Spare, fully-charged battery packs

 Additional printer driver files if you plan to use another printer

 Proof of purchase, in case you need to show it to customs officials

 International Travelers Warranty passport

Special considerations

Follow the same special considerations as when traveling with the computer. In 
addition, these tips are useful when traveling internationally:

 When traveling in another country, check that the local AC voltage and the 
AC adapter power cord specifications are compatible. If not, purchase a 
power cord that is compatible with the local AC voltage. Do not use 
converter kits sold for appliances to power the computer.

 If you are using the modem, check if the modem and connector is 
compatible with the telecommunications system of the country you are 
traveling in.

Playing DVD movies

When the DVD drive module is installed in the optical drive bay, you can play 
DVD movies on your computer.

1 Insert a DVD movie disk.

Important! When you launch the DVD player for the first time, the 
program asks you to enter the region code. DVD disks are divided 
into 6 regions. Once your DVD drive is set to a region code, it will 
play DVD disks of that region only. You can set the region code a 
maximum of five times (including the first time), after which the 
last region code set will remain permanent. Recovering your hard 
disk does not reset the number of times the region code has been 
set. Refer to the table below for DVD movie region code 
information.

2 The DVD movie will automatically play after a few seconds.

Region code Country or region

1 USA, Canada

2 Europe, Middle East, South Africa, Japan

3 Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea

4 Latin America, Australia, New Zealand

5 Former USSR, parts of Africa, India

6 People's Republic of China
