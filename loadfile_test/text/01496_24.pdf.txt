Highlights of GAO-06-399, a report to 
congressional requesters 

Alaska Native corporations (ANC) 
were created to settle land claims 
with Alaska Natives and foster 
economic development. In 1986, 
legislation passed that allowed 
ANCs to participate in the Small 
Business Administration’s (SBA) 
8(a) program. Since then, Congress 
has extended special procurement 
advantages to 8(a) ANC firms, such 
as the ability to win sole-source 
contracts for any dollar amount. 
This report identifies (1) trends in 
the government’s 8(a) contracting 
with ANC firms, (2) the reasons 
agencies have awarded 8(a) sole-
source contracts to ANC firms and 
the facts and circumstances behind 
some of these contracts, and (3) 
how ANCs are using the 8(a) 
program. GAO also evaluated 
SBA’s oversight of 8(a) ANC firms.   

What GAO Recommends  
GAO recommends that SBA take 
actions to improve oversight of 
ANC 8(a) activity and recommends 
that the seven procuring agencies 
in this review provide guidance to 
contracting officers.  GAO received 
comments on the draft report from 
all 8 agencies in the review and the 
Native American Contractors 
Association.  The procuring 
agencies agreed with the 
recommendation, except for the 
Department of Energy which did 
not address it.  SBA expressed 
concern with aspects of the report 
and, in a subsequent e-mail, 
disagreed with several of our 
recommendations. GAO disagrees 
with SBA’s comments and believes 
its recommendations need to be 
implemented.

ONTRACT MANAGEMENT 

ncreased Use of Alaska Native 
rporations’ Special 8(a) Provisions 
lls for Tailored Oversight 

hile representing a small amount of total federal procurement spending,
(a) obligations to firms owned by ANCs increased from $265 million in 
iscal year 2000 to $1.1 billion in 2004. In fiscal year 2004, obligations to ANC 
irms represented 13 percent of total 8(a) dollars. Sole-source awards 
epresented about 77 percent of 8(a) ANC obligations for the six procuring 
gencies that accounted for the vast majority of total ANC obligations over 
he 5-year period. These sole-source contracts can represent a broad range 
f services, as illustrated in GAO’s contract file sample, which included 
ontracts for construction in Brazil, training of security guards in Iraq, and 
nformation technology services in Washington, D.C.   

n general, acquisition officials at the agencies reviewed told GAO that the 
ption of using ANC firms under the 8(a) program allows them to quickly, 
asily, and legally award contracts for any value.  They also noted that these 
ontracts help them meet small business goals. In reviewing selected large, 
ole-source 8(a) contracts awarded to ANC firms, GAO found that 
ontracting officials had not always complied with certain requirements, 
uch as notifying SBA of contract modifications and monitoring the percent 
f work that is subcontracted.  

NCs use the 8(a) program to generate revenue with the goal of providing 
enefits to their shareholders. These benefits take many forms, including 
ividend payments, scholarships, internships, and support for elder 
hareholders.  A detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the ANCs is 
ncluded as appendix X of the report.  Some ANCs are heavily reliant on the 
(a) program for revenues, while others approach the program as one of 
any revenue-generating opportunities. GAO found that some ANCs have 

ncreasingly made use of the congressionally authorized advantages afforded 
o them. One of the key practices is the creation of multiple 8(a) 
ubsidiaries, sometimes in highly diversified lines of business.  From fiscal 
ear 1988 to 2005, ANC 8(a) subsidiaries increased from one subsidiary 
wned by one ANC to 154 subsidiaries owned by 49 ANCs.  
United States Government Accountability Office

BA, which is responsible for implementing the 8(a) program, has not 
ailored its policies and practices to account for ANCs’ unique status and 
rowth in the 8(a) program, even though SBA officials recognize that ANCs 
nter into more complex business relationships than other 8(a) participants. 
reas where SBA’s oversight has fallen short include: determining whether 
ore than one subsidiary of the same ANC is generating a majority of its 

evenue in the same primary industry, consistently determining whether 
wards to 8(a) ANC firms have resulted in other small businesses losing 
ontract opportunities, and ensuring that the partnerships between 8(a) ANC 
irms and large firms are functioning in the way they were intended. During 
ur review, SBA officials agreed that improvements are needed and said they 
re planning to revise their regulations and policies.

Congressional Requesters: 

In December 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (ANCSA)1 to resolve long-standing aboriginal land claims and to foster 
economic development for Alaska Natives. This legislation created Alaska 
Native corporations (ANC), which would become the vehicle for 
distributing land and monetary benefits to Alaska Natives in lieu of a 
reservation system.2 ANSCA permitted the conveyance of about 44 million 
acres of land to the ANCs, along with cash payments of almost $1 billion in 
exchange for extinguishing the aboriginal land claims in Alaska. Regional 
corporations were required to be formed as profit-making entities, while 
village, urban, and group corporations could decide whether to be profit or 
nonprofit entities. As of December 2005, there were 13 regional 
corporations and 182 village, urban, and group corporations. ANCSA does 
not set any requirements on how ANCs are to use the profits they 
generate. 

In 1986, legislation passed that allowed ANC-owned businesses to 
participate in the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 8(a) program—
one of the federal government’s primary means for developing small 
businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. 
This program allows the government to award contracts to participating 
small businesses without competition below certain dollar thresholds. 
Congress has repeatedly emphasized in legislation the business 
development aspects of the 8(a) program. Each 8(a) firm, including those 
owned by ANCs, must qualify as small under an industry size standard as 
measured by number of employees or average revenues from the previous 
3 years, and must be majority-owned by a disadvantaged individual or a 
qualified entity, such as an ANC. Firms approved as 8(a) participants can 
receive business development assistance from SBA and are eligible to 
receive contracts that agencies offer to SBA for the 8(a) program. In 1998, 
SBA started negotiating memorandums of understanding (MOU) that 

                                                                                                                                    
1Pub.L. 92-203 (codified as amended in 43 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.). 

2 Aside from monetary benefits, ANCs also provide other benefits to their shareholders, 
such as scholarships, internships, burial assistance, and benefits for elder shareholders. 
The benefits ANCs provide are discussed in detail in appendix X. 

Page 1 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

allowed federal agencies to contract directly with 8(a) firms. The MOUs 
(also called partnership agreements), delegate contract execution 
responsibility to the agencies and require them to monitor certain 
requirements of the contract. 

Since 1986, Congress has extended special procurement advantages to 
ANC firms beyond those afforded to other 8(a) businesses.3 Table 1 shows 
the advantages. 4 

                                                                                                                                    
3In this report, the term “ANC” refers to the parent corporation, usually located in Alaska. 
The term “ANC firm” denotes a business owned by an ANC. This has the same meaning as 
“ANC-owned concern” which is the term used in SBA’s small business regulation. We use 
the term “subsidiary,” as used in ANSCA, to refer to direct and indirect ANC subsidiaries. 

4We found the legislative history leading to the procurement advantages to be sparse and to 
contain some confusing language. For example, legislative language suggests that 8(a) 
businesses owned by Indian tribes (defined to include ANCs) were exempt from sole-
source dollar thresholds because such businesses are located on reservations and account 
for the major employment of the workforce. ANCs, however, do not have reservations.

Note: Other g roups, such as I ndian tribes, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and Community 
Development Corporations, have some advantages in the 8(a) program similar to those afforded 
ANCs. Further, Congress has provided preferences to businesses owned by Indian tribes (defined t o 
include ANCs), under the Office of Management and Budget’s A-7 6 program in several prior Defen se 
Appropriation Acts, including the D efense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006. Dep artment of 
Defense Approp riations Act, 2006, Pub. L. 109-148 § 8014(b )(1)(C). 
 
Recently, a number of high-dollar, sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded to 
ANC firms have attracted the attention of Congress and the media. This 
report identifies (1) trends in the government’s 8(a) contracting with ANCs 
from fiscal years 2000 to 2004; (2) the reasons agencies have awarded 8(a) 
sole-source contracts to ANC firms and the facts and circumstances 
behind some of these contracts; and (3) how ANCs are using the 8(a) 
program. In addition, we evaluated SBA’s oversight of 8(a) ANC firms, 
given these companies’ unique procurement advantages. 

Page 3 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

To gather data on federal 8(a) contracting with ANCs, we identified each 
ANC firm’s Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number5 and used 
this information to obtain data from the Federal Procurement Data System 
(FPDS) for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. We tested the FPDS data for 
reliability by comparing this information with procurement data submitted 
by six agencies that accounted for almost 85 percent of total 8(a) ANC 
obligations over the 5-year period: the departments of Defense, Energy, 
the Interior, State, and Transportation and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA). We planned to include the Department of 
Homeland Security’s data in our trend analysis but did not do so for two 
reasons. First, because the department became operational in March 2003, 
FPDS data would reflect only part of fiscal year 2003 and beyond. Second, 
we found that the data from Homeland Security were inconsistent, and 
therefore questioned the reliability of the data overall.  

We analyzed documents provided by SBA’s headquarters and Alaska 
district office and interviewed officials from those offices. We reviewed  
16 large, sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded to ANC firms by the six 
agencies cited above as well as by the Department of Homeland Security 
and interviewed appropriate contracting officials. We traveled to Alaska 
and met with executives representing 30 ANCs, including each of the  
13 regional ANCs and 17 village or urban corporations. Of the  
30 corporations, 26 were participating in the 8(a) program and 4 were not 
at the time of our review. We also spoke with Alaska Native shareholders 
and reviewed the companies’ annual reports and other relevant 
documentation. Figure 1 depicts the sites we visited in Alaska.

We also spoke with representatives from small businesses, an 8(a) 
association, and the Native American Contractors Association. Our work 
included a detailed review of the laws, regulations, and legislative history 
that afforded ANCs their special 8(a) provisions. Appendix I contains more 

Page 5 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

details on our scope and methodology. We conducted our review from 
April 2005 to March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted 
government auditing standards. 

 
While representing a small amount of total federal procurement spending, 
dollars obligated to ANC firms through the 8(a) program grew from  
$265 million in fiscal year 2000 to $1.1 billion in 2004, with a noticeable 
increase in 2003. Overall during the 5-year period, the government 
obligated $4.6 billion to ANC firms, of which $2.9 billion, or 63 percent, 
went through the 8(a) program. About 13 percent of total 8(a) dollars were 
obligated to ANC firms in fiscal year 2004. For the six agencies included in 
our trend analysis, sole-source 8(a) obligations to ANC firms rose from 
about $180 million in fiscal year 2000 to $876 million in fiscal year 2004, 
representing about 77 percent of these agencies’ total obligations to 8(a) 
ANC firms over the 5-year period. As illustrated in our contract file sample, 
these sole-source contracts can represent a broad range of services, such 
as contracts for construction in Brazil, training of security guards in Iraq, 
and information technology services in Washington, D.C. 

Results in Brief 

Agency officials told us they have turned to 8(a) ANC firms as a quick, 
easy, and legal method of awarding contracts for any value. At the same 
time, the officials noted that these contracts help them meet small 
business goals. In our review of selected large dollar value, sole-source 
contracts, we found that contracting officials had not always complied 
with requirements to notify SBA when modifying the contracts to increase 
the scope or dollar value and to monitor the percentage of work 
performed by the ANC firms versus their subcontractors. One contracting 
officer was under the impression that the scope of work could be 
expanded to include any additional lines of business not in the original 
contract because it was a sole-source 8(a) ANC contract. 

ANCs use the 8(a) program as one of many tools to generate revenue with 
the goal of benefiting their shareholders. Appendix X contains detailed 
information on benefits the corporations are providing. Some ANCs are 
heavily reliant on the 8(a) program for revenues, while others approach 
the program as one of many revenue-generating opportunities, such as 
investments in stocks or real estate. ANCs are using the congressionally 
authorized advantages afforded to them, such as ownership of multiple 
8(a) subsidiaries, sometimes in diversified lines of business. From fiscal 
year 1988 to 2005, numbers increased from one 8(a) subsidiary owned by 
one ANC to 154 subsidiaries owned by 49 ANCs, with the largest growth 
occurring in recent years. ANCs sometimes leverage expertise and 

Page 6 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

management by sharing staff and expertise among subsidiaries to win new 
contracts and create a subsidiary to win a follow-on contract when the 
original subsidiary outgrows its designation as “small.” Another practice is 
partial ownership of subsidiaries, which in some cases means that 
subsidiary executives retain a portion of the profit they generate—up to  
44 percent in one case we found. Other ANCs have purposely limited their 
8(a) involvement to a targeted industry with the goal of becoming 
independently sustainable—a strategy that, in their view, is consistent 
with the business development intent of the 8(a) program. ANCs have also 
formed partnerships with other ANCs or other firms to increase 
opportunities to obtain federal contracts. Finally, some ANCs have created 
holding companies to increase efficiency across multiple subsidiaries. 

SBA has not tailored its policies and practices to account for ANCs’ unique 
status in the 8(a) program and their growth in federal contracting, even 
though SBA officials recognize that ANC firms enter into more complex 
business relationships than other 8(a) participants. The officials agreed 
that improvements are needed and told us they are planning to revise their 
regulations and policies. Examples where SBA’s oversight has fallen short 
include not 

 determining whether more than one subsidiary of the same ANC is 
generating the majority of revenue under the same primary industry;6 

 consistently determining whether other small businesses are losing 
contracting opportunities when large, sole-source 8(a) contracts are 
awarded to ANC firms; 

 adhering to a legislative and regulatory requirement to ascertain 
whether 8(a) ANC firms have, or are likely to obtain, a substantial 
unfair competitive advantage within an industry; 

 ensuring that the partnerships between ANC firms and large firms are 
functioning in the way they were intended under the 8(a) program; and 

 maintaining information on ANCs’ 8(a) activity. 
 
SBA officials told us that they have faced a challenge in overseeing the 
activity of the 8(a) ANC firms because ANCs’ charter under ANCSA is not 
always consistent with the business development intent of the 8(a) 
program. They noted that the goal of ANCs—economic development for 
Alaska Natives from a community standpoint—can be in conflict with the 

                                                                                                                                    
6The primary industry is the primary line of work that the 8(a) firm performs. 8(a) concerns 
may also seek opportunities through secondary business activities, as long as they qualify 
as small for the size standards pertaining to each line of work.  

Page 7 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

primary purpose of the 8(a) program, which is business development for 
individual small, disadvantaged businesses. 
 
We make recommendations in this report to SBA on actions that can be 
taken in revising its regulations and policies as well as ways to improve 
practices pertaining to its oversight of ANC 8(a) procurements. We also 
recommend that the procuring agencies involved in our review work with 
SBA to develop guidance for their contracting officers on how to comply 
with the requirements of the 8(a) program to help address some problems 
we found with the 8(a) sole-source contracts we reviewed.  

Six of the procuring agencies involved in our review agreed with the 
recommendation we made to them. The Department of Energy did not 
comment on the recommendation. In some cases, the agencies provided 
technical comments or clarifications, which we incorporated as 
appropriate. We also received written comments from the Native 
American Contractors Association. The association believes that we 
should more fully acknowledge the legal and policy basis of 8(a) program 
rules for native entities and that we should provide a broader perspective 
on issues that impact the entire federal procurement system. We believe 
we have adequately addressed the legal and policy basis for the ANCs’ 8(a) 
provisions. While we have reported in the past on the broader issues 
raised by the association,7 these matters were outside the scope of this 
particular audit. In separate technical comments, the association 
suggested we add, for context, total federal government spending. We 
have added this information as a note to figure 3. 

In written comments on a draft of this report, SBA took issue with several 
aspects of the report, stating that the concerns we raised were “subjective” 
and based on isolated individual anecdotes. We strongly disagree with 
SBA’s characterization of our report. Our findings are supported by the 
facts we gathered during our audit and the analyses we conducted, and 
these findings directly support the recommendations we make. It is an

undisputed fact that 8(a) ANC activity has increased in recent years. 
Clearly, 6 of the 7 procuring agencies involved in our review—which 
account for most of the government’s 8(a) dollars to ANC firms—agree 
that they need to partner with SBA to ensure that contracting officers 
understand the tailored provisions Congress has provided these firms. 
SBA stated that it has taken a number of steps to improve oversight of the 
8(a) program, including taking into consideration special provisions 
afforded to ANC concerns. Despite our requests throughout our review for 
specific information on actions SBA was taking, the agency did not 
provide us with any evidence that would support its statement. SBA’s 
comment letter did not indicate whether it plans to implement our 
recommendations, but in a subsequent e-mail SBA expressed 
disagreement with several of them. A detailed discussion of the comments 
begins in the “Agency Comments” section of this report. 

The written comments we received are included in their entirety in 
appendixes II through VIII. 

 
ANSCA created 12 regional ANCs, each representing a region of Alaska, 
and a 13th corporation for Alaska Natives living outside Alaska. There are 
also 182 village, urban, and group corporations located within the  
12 regions.8 In most cases, the regional corporations received a mixture of 
surface and subsurface rights to land while the village, urban, or group 
corporations received only surface rights. Some village corporations opted 
out of the ANCSA settlement to receive surface and subsurface rights to 
their former reservation lands and relinquished all ANSCA benefits, 
including claims to additional land, monetary payments, or shares of stock 
in a regional corporation. Additionally, in some cases, village corporations 
merged with each other or with the regional corporation. 

Background 

The legislative history of ANSCA is focused on economic development for 
the benefit of Alaska Natives. Each eligible Alaska Native is generally 
entitled to membership both in the corporation established for his or her 
village and in the regional corporation in which the village is located. As 
shareholders, Alaska Natives are entitled to a voice in the management of 
and a share in the lands, assets, and income as decided by the board of 

                                                                                                                                    
8ANCSA created village corporations for communities of 25 or more Alaska Natives, group 
corporations for associations of fewer than 25 Alaska Natives, and urban corporations for 
urban communities of Alaska Natives.

directors of the corporations, which own and manage the land and money. 
ANCSA implemented restrictions that generally allow original 
shareholders to transfer shares only under certain circumstances, such as 
divorce or through a gift or a will.9 Additionally, four of the  
30 corporations we reviewed have chosen to issue new stock to 
descendants of the original shareholders or those who did not have the 
opportunity to enroll as a shareholder originally. 

ANCs vary widely in number of shareholders and profitability. Table 2 
illustrates some examples.

For ANC firms in the 8(a) program, SBA has specific oversight 
responsibility for 

 accepting the firm into the 8(a) program, which includes ensuring that 
the ANC does not have more than one 8(a) firm in the same primary 
line of business, defined by a North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) code;10 

                                                                                                                                    
943 U.S.C. 1606(g)(2) and (h)(1)(C). Although the ANCs have ownership and control over 
their lands, the act provided that Alaska Natives could not sell their shares of corporation 
stock to the public for 20 years after December 18, 1971 (Pub.L. 92-203 § 7(h)). In 1988, 
Congress extended this provision, but gave the individual Natives the option to sell the 
stock publicly if a majority of the shareholders approved. (Pub.L. 100-241 § 8 codified at  
43 U.S.C. 1629c).  

10SBA has designated a small business size standard for every NAICS code. 8(a) applicants 
must qualify as small under their primary NAICS code at the time of application and SBA’s 
certification date. SBA regulation requires that at least 2 years lapse after an ANC firm exits 
the 8(a) program before another firm owned by the same parent ANC can enter the 
program with the prior firm’s primary NAICS code. However, once accepted into the 
program, 8(a) firms may pursue contracts in any line of work, called secondary NAICS 
codes.  

Page 10 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

 verifying each firm’s size status to ensure that it qualifies as small 
under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement; and 

 annually reviewing 8(a) firms to track their progress in the 8(a) 
program. 
 

There is a 9-year limit to participation in the 8(a) program, and firms—
including ANC firms—are required to obtain a certain percentage of non-
8(a) revenue during the last five years to demonstrate their progress in 
developing a viable business that is not reliant on the 8(a) program. SBA’s 
district offices are responsible for tracking the business mix of 8(a) and 
non-8(a) revenue on an annual basis. If a firm does not meet its required 
business mix during one of the last five years, SBA invokes a plan of 
remedial action for the next year, in which the firm reports to SBA its 
progress toward compliance with the required business mix. Until the 
required mix is demonstrated, the firm will not be eligible for sole-source 
8(a) contracts. Currently there are over 9,400 firms in the 8(a) program. 
 

From fiscal year 2000 to 2004, the federal government obligated a total of 
about $4.6 billion to ANC firms, of which $2.9 billion, or 63 percent, went 
through the 8(a) program. About 13 percent of total 8(a) dollars were 
obligated to ANC firms in fiscal year 2004. Further, from fiscal year 2000 to 
2004, sole-source awards accounted for 77 percent of ANC 8(a) contracts 
for the six agencies in our trend analysis. The sole-source 8(a) contracts 
that we reviewed demonstrate the wide diversity of services provided by 
ANC firms worldwide. 

 
Our analysis, based on FPDS data, shows that federal dollars obligated to 
ANC firms through the 8(a) program grew from $265 million in fiscal year 
2000 to $1.1 billion in 2004, with a noticeable increase in 2003. Over the  
5-year period, about 63 percent of the government’s obligations to ANC 
firms went through the 8(a) program. Figure 2 shows the breakdown 
between 8(a) and non-8(a) dollars obligated to ANC firms.

Increasing Percentage of 
Total 8(a) Dollars 
Obligated to ANC Firms 

We also analyzed the percentage of total 8(a) dollars obligated to ANC 
firms from fiscal years 2000 to 2004. Total obligations to all 8(a) firms grew 
from about $5.8 billion in fiscal year 2000 to about $8.4 billion in fiscal year 
2004. The percentage obligated to 8(a) ANC firms grew from about  
5 percent to about 13 percent during this time period. Whereas obligations 
to 8(a) ANC firms decreased only slightly between fiscal years 2003 and 
2004, dollars obligated to other 8(a) firms decreased by almost $2 billion 
during that same time frame. SBA officials could not explain the decrease.

2004 was more than $341 billion, ac cording to FP DS data. 
 

For the six agencies included in our 8(a) trend analysis, sole-source 
obligations to ANC firms increased from about $180 million in fiscal year 
2000 to almost $876 million in fiscal year 2004. Over the five-year period, 
sole-source obligations represented about 77 percent of these agencies’ 
total obligations to 8(a) ANC firms.

In recent years, ANC firms have performed a wide variety of services for 
the federal government, spanning 18 broad industries, across the United 
States and overseas. The services included facilities support services; 
construction; professional, scientific, and technical services; information 
technology services; and manufacturing. Our review of selected large sole-
source 8(a) contracts further demonstrates the wide diversity of services 
provided by ANC firms, as shown in table 3.

In general, acquisition officials at the agencies we reviewed told us that 
the option of using ANC firms under the 8(a) program allows them to 
quickly, easily, and legally award contracts for any value. They also 
pointed out that awarding 8(a) contracts to ANC firms helps agencies meet 
their small business goals. Our review of 16 large sole-source contracts 
found that contracting officials had not always complied with 
requirements to notify SBA when modifying contracts, such as increasing 
the scope of work or the dollar value, and to monitor the percentage of the 
work performed by 8(a) firms versus their subcontractors. 

 
Agency officials told us that awarding sole-source contracts to 8(a) ANC 
firms is an easy and expedient method of meeting time-sensitive 
requirements. Some examples follow. 

Agency Officials View 
Contracting with ANC 
Firms as Quick and 
Easy, but Rules Not 
Always Followed 

Sole-Source 8(a) Contracts 
to ANC Firms Viewed as 
Expedient 

 An Army contracting official told us that his agency’s limited 
contracting staff was the primary reason his office awarded an 8(a) 
sole-source contract to an ANC firm for base operations support. The 
official added that this contract had been competitively awarded three 
times previously to large businesses, but in 1999 his office decided it 
did not have the staff to administer another full and open competition. 

 Another Army official commented that she had to fill an urgent 
requirement for water and fuel tanks in support of the war in Iraq. 
Rather than directly award to a large manufacturer, which would 
require a justification and approval process for a sole-source award, 
the contract went sole source to an 8(a) ANC firm as a quicker 
acquisition strategy given the time-sensitive nature of the requirement. 

 An e-mail in the contract file from a NASA official remarked that a sole-
source award to an ANC firm would save much time as opposed to 
having to work through a competitive process, since the office was 
running short on available staff. Another NASA official stated that the 

Page 16 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

additional resources needed to run a competitive procurement would 
likely negate any monetary savings that might be gained through 
competition. 

 Another contracting official told us that it was the “unofficial” policy in 
his organization that for urgent requirements over the competitive 
limits for other 8(a) firms, an ANC firm is sought out. He described 
contracting with ANC firms as an “open checkbook” since sole-source 
awards can be made for any dollar amount. 

 
We found one example, however, where the process of awarding to an 
8(a) ANC firm was not particularly expedient. An ANC firm proposed a 
price for a State Department construction contract that was almost twice 
as much as the government’s original cost estimate. The State Department 
negotiated extensively for over a month, requesting four different price 
proposals from the contractor. At one point, the contracting office 
considered terminating the solicitation and awarding competitively to a 
prequalified firm, but due to time constraints the department decided to 
accept the ANC firm’s final proposal, which was still slightly over the 
government’s estimate. 

In another example from our file review, the Interior Department’s 
GovWorks11 awarded a sole-source 8(a) contract on behalf of the 
Department of Defense’s (DOD) Counter Intelligence Field Activity (CIFA) 
to an ANC firm. The contract was primarily to consolidate and co-locate 
the space available for contractor personnel, but also included some work 
to oversee construction and facilities program management. This 
contractor, which specialized in information technology services, told us it 
had been approached by CIFA for this project because it had successfully 
obtained space for another government agency. When awarding the 
contract, GovWorks did not consider any alternatives other than sole-
source contracting with the ANC firm because CIFA had requested that 
firm. Contractor officials told us that the cost of the office space was 
incidental to a larger project for CIFA, yet we found that over 80 percent 
of the contract price was for the space. Furthermore, although SBA’s 

                                                                                                                                    
11GovWorks is a franchise fund within the Department of the Interior. Franchise funds are 
government-run, self-supporting businesslike enterprises managed by federal employees. 
They provide a variety of common administrative services, such as payroll processing and 
contracting support, to government agencies. We recently reported on franchise funds and 
placed management of interagency contracting on our high risk list. GAO, Interagency 
Contracting: Franchise Funds Provide Convenience, but Value to DOD is Not 
Demonstrated, GAO-05-456, (Washington, D.C.: July 29, 2005) and GAO, High-Risk Series: 
An Update, GAO-05-207 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 2005).  

Page 17 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

Alaska district office had accepted the contract under the 8(a) program, a 
subsequent size determination found that at the time of award, the 
contractor did not qualify as small under the size standard for the 
contract.12 

We also found an example where an agency could have competed the 
contract had there been adequate acquisition planning, but chose to award 
sole-source to an ANC firm because it was easier method. The Immigration 
and Naturalization Service13 awarded a facilities operation and 
maintenance contract for a federal detention facility. A contracting official 
who reviewed the presolicitation and pre-award packages told us that this 
was a recurring requirement and the contracting officer should have 
known well in advance that the existing contract was expiring. With 
sufficient acquisition planning the agency could have awarded an  
8(a) competitive contract, according to this official. However, he was 
advised by the contracting officer that awarding to an ANC firm was the 
quickest and easiest method and avoided competition. We reviewed the 
contract file and did not find a formal acquisition plan that addressed the 
strategy used. We reported in 2003 that the lack of adequate advanced 
planning by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for several 
detention center contracts limited opportunities for competition.14 

 
ANC 8(a) Awards Help 
Agencies Meet Small 
Business Goals 

The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 directed the President to 
establish a goal of not less than 23 percent of the federal government’s 
prime contracting dollars to be awarded to small businesses each fiscal 
year.15 As part of this goal, Congress has directed that 5 percent of prime 
contract dollars be directed to small, disadvantaged businesses. SBA is 

                                                                                                                                    
12According to an SBA official, a calculation error was made in determining the ANC firm’s 
average revenues over the past 3 years, which resulted in the SBA’s Alaska district office 
approving the ANC firm for the contract.  

13The Immigration and Naturalization Service was absorbed into the Department of 
Homeland Security in March 2003.

charged with working with federal agencies to ensure that agency goals, in 
the aggregate, meet or exceed these goals.16 

Several contracting officers told us that they had turned to 8(a) ANC 
contracts as a way to help their agencies meet small business goals. ANC 
firms in the 8(a) program are deemed in legislation as socially and 
economically disadvantaged. Because contract awards can be categorized 
by agencies to allow them to take credit in more than one small business 
category, awards to 8(a) ANC firms can be applied to the agencies’ overall 
small business goal as well as to their small, disadvantaged business goal. 
One Energy contracting official told us that there is tremendous pressure 
to award contracts to small businesses, so she turns to 8(a) ANC firms 
whenever possible. A NASA official told us that his contracting office had 
been aggressive in promoting socioeconomic development with small 
disadvantaged businesses and had particularly wanted to award a contract 
to benefit the Native American community. Although several small 
businesses expressed interest in NASA’s requirement for technical and 
fabrication support services, rather than compete the procurement, NASA 
opted for a sole-source award with an 8(a) ANC firm. 

 
Required Notifications of 
Contract Modifications 
Not Always Done 

SBA regulation requires that, where the contract execution function is 
delegated to the agencies, they must report to SBA all 8(a) contract 
awards, modifications, and options. Further, the MOUs between SBA and 
the agencies require the agencies to provide SBA with copies of all 8(a) 
contracts, including modifications, within 15 days of the date of award. 
However, we found that contracting officers were not consistently 
following this requirement. While some had notified SBA when 
incorporating additional services into the contract or when modifying the 
contract ceiling amount, others had not. 

One contracting official told us that SBA has “stepped aside” when it 
comes to overseeing 8(a) contracts and that it would not occur to her to 
coordinate a contract modification, such as a scope change, with SBA. We 
also found the following example where the contracting officer was under 

                                                                                                                                    
16On June 3, 2005, a rule was proposed to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to 
allow, among other things, large businesses to count subcontracts to ANC firms toward 
their small business subcontracting goals, even if the firms are not small businesses, 
certified small disadvantaged businesses, or certified 8(a) firms under SBA’s regulations. 
This rule proposes to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement § 702 of 
Pub.L. 107-117, as amended by § 3003 of Pub.L. 107-206. 

Page 19 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

the impression that the scope of work could be expanded to include any 
additional lines of business not in the original contract because it was a 
sole-source 8(a) ANC contract. 

 The Department of Energy awarded an $8.5 million sole-source 
contract to an ANC firm for administrative and general management 
consulting services, but one year later broadened the scope of work to 
include 10 additional lines of business related to facilities management 
support and engineering services. The additional work almost tripled 
the cost of the contract, raising it to $25 million. None of these changes 
were coordinated with SBA, despite the fact that SBA’s letter to the 
Department of Energy approving the procurement clearly stated that if 
the statement of work was changed, SBA would have to re-determine 
the appropriateness of the NAICS code and the acceptability of the 
offer under the 8(a) program. The contracting official acknowledged 
that the scope change should have been coordinated with SBA, but her 
understanding was that because it was an ANC firm, anything could be 
added to the contract regardless of the dollar amount. By adding 
additional lines of business to the contract, the contracting officer was 
potentially improperly expanding beyond the scope of the contract. 
Moreover, by not notifying SBA, the agency had no assurance that this 
ANC firm qualified as small under the contract’s additional lines of 
business. 

 
We found that SBA’s letters to the agencies approving 8(a) procurements 
did not always reiterate the notification requirement. Of the 16 contract 
files we reviewed, we found only five cases where the letter requested that 
all contract modifications be coordinated with SBA. Four of these 
specifically requested the agency to forward a copy of any scope changes. 
SBA officials could not explain why the acceptance letters were 
inconsistent. SBA officials in Alaska recently revised their approval letter 
template, which now requests copies of contract modifications if 
additional work is being added to the original contract or an option year is 
being exercised. 

 
Contracting Officials Not 
Consistently Monitoring 
Subcontracting 

The “limitations on subcontracting” clause in the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation requires that, for 8(a) service contracts with subcontracting 
activity, the 8(a) firm must incur at least 50 percent of the personnel costs 
with its own employees (for general construction contracts, the firm must

incur at least 15 percent of the personnel costs).17 The purpose of this 
provision, which limits the amount of work that can be performed by the 
subcontractor, is to insure that small businesses do not pass along the 
benefits of their contracts to their subcontractors.18 For the 16 files we 
reviewed, we found almost no evidence that the agencies are effectively 
monitoring compliance with this requirement, particularly where 8(a) ANC 
firms have partnered with large firms. As a result, there is an increased 
risk that an inappropriate degree of the work is being done by large 
businesses rather than by the ANC firms. 

The procuring agency and the 8(a) firm both play a role in ensuring 
compliance with the limitations on subcontracting clause. The MOUs 
between SBA and the procuring agencies state that the agencies are 
responsible for the monitoring. SBA’s regulation requires the 8(a) firms to 
certify in their offers to the appropriate SBA district office that they will 
meet the applicable percentage of work requirement for each contract 
when subcontracting. 

In general, the contracting officers we spoke with were confused about 
whose responsibility it is to monitor compliance with the subcontracting 
limitations. Some thought it was SBA’s responsibility; one asserted that the 
contractor was responsible for self-monitoring; and others acknowledged 
that it was their responsibility but were not monitoring it formally. For the 
contracts in our file review, SBA’s letters to agencies approving the 8(a) 
procurements were not consistent in reminding contracting officers to 
include the limitations on subcontracting clause in the contract. Six of the 
letters did not include this language. We brought this discrepancy to the 
attention of SBA officials, who stated that all approval letters should 
contain this requirement as standard language. In addition, we found that 
two of the awarded contracts did not contain the limitation on 
subcontracting clause, as required. The responsible contracting officials 
told us the clause should have been included and was omitted as a result 
of an oversight. 

                                                                                                                                    
17FAR 52.219-14, “Limitations on Subcontracting.” FAR 19.811-3(e). In the case of a contract 
for supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer in such supplies), the 
concern will perform at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not 
including the cost of materials.

America and Strong Vessel Operators LLC. No. 05-866C filed September 30, 2005.

We also found that contracting officers were unclear about how to 
monitor the subcontracting requirements under indefinite quantity 
contracts, under which agencies place task or delivery orders.19 SBA’s 8(a) 
regulation states that for indefinite quantity service or supply contracts, 
the participant must demonstrate semi-annually whether it has performed 
50 percent of personnel costs with its own employees for the combined 
total of all task or delivery orders at the end of each 6-month period. This 
does not mean that the 50-percent minimum requirement applies to work 
performed under each individual task order or that a contractor must meet 
the requirement cumulatively for all work performed under all task orders 
at any given point in time. We found contracting officers who 
misinterpreted the regulation to mean that the contractor must perform 
the required percentage over the life of the entire contract. As a result, one 
contracting officer decided it was too difficult and thus did not monitor 
the subcontracting effort. 

In one example from our file review, the Energy Department awarded a 
sole-source indefinite quantity contract for a construction project to an 
8(a) ANC firm primarily because this firm had a previous business 
relationship with the large incumbent contractor and planned to use the 
incumbent as a subcontractor for the new contract. The contracting 
officer believed that the limitations on subcontracting must be 
demonstrated by the end of the entire contract period. We reviewed an 
invoice that showed that cumulatively for all tasks to date, the subcontract 
labor costs made up 90 percent of the total labor, which would indicate 
the need for attention to be paid to the 6-month task order review 
requirement.20 

An agency contracting official told us that it is not uncommon for large 
businesses to approach him wanting to know how to “partner” with an 
ANC firm. Furthermore, representatives from one ANC firm told us that an 
agency had awarded it a “pass-through” contract, or one where the 
subcontractor performs most of the work, to take advantage of the 8(a) 
ANC firm’s ability to obtain sole-source contracts. The agency wanted to 

                                                                                                                                    
19This type of contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies 
or services during a fixed period. The government places orders for individual 
requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.  

20SBA regulation states that for indefinite quantity contracts for general construction, the 
participant must demonstrate semi-annually that it has incurred 15 percent minimum of the 
personnel cost for all orders issued. 

Page 22 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

contract with a particular business, but could not award a sole-source 
contract directly to that business. The agency awarded the contract to the 
ANC firm and required it, through a directed subcontracting plan, to 
subcontract with the desired business. 

When asked what recourse contracting officers would take if they found 
an 8(a) firm to be out of compliance with the limitations on 
subcontracting, some agency officials responded that they had no plan in 
place. In fact, one contracting officer commented that he would be 
“laughed out of the office” if he brought up the compliance issue as a 
reason for terminating the contract. Several contracting officials told us 
that they review the cost proposals to assess how much work was planned 
to be subcontracted out, but they do not follow up during contract 
performance to ensure that the prime contractor complies with the plan. 
In one case, we found that an 8(a) ANC firm’s technical proposal to the 
Department of Transportation for an information technology consolidation 
project included an intention to subcontract with a large firm, yet did not 
clearly delineate the breakout of work between the firms. From reviewing 
the agency’s evaluation of the proposal, we did not find any evidence that 
contracting officials questioned the relationship or the division of labor 
prior to contract award. Later, however, the contracting officer modified 
the contract to require the 8(a) firm to provide semi-annual subcontracting 
reports that would detail the subcontracting percentage for the previous  
6 months.  

 
ANCs use the 8(a) program as one of many tools to generate revenue with 
the goal of providing benefits to their shareholders. ANCs participating in 
the 8(a) program have various business strategies to maximize revenue. 
For example, some own multiple 8(a) subsidiaries, either in niche markets 
or diversified industries. Others recruit outside expertise to manage their 
8(a) operations. Additionally, many form partnerships—with other ANCs 
or other businesses—and holding companies for increased efficiencies. 

 
Federal contracts awarded through the 8(a) program are one of a number 
of sources of revenue, such as timber, tourism, real estate, or market 
investments, for ANCs participating in the 8(a) program. Corporations 
consolidate their income to fund operations at the parent level, to invest in 
subsidiary operations, and to provide benefits to shareholders. Figure 5 
shows a sample ANC’s revenue sources.

Some corporations rely on federal contracting with 8(a) subsidiaries as a 
primary revenue source, while others do not. For example, of the five 
corporations whose subsidiaries comprised 76 percent of the 
government’s 8(a) ANC dollars from fiscal years 2000 to 2004, three 
depend almost exclusively on current, exited, or planned participants in 
the 8(a) program for their revenues. However, for the other two 
corporations, 8(a) subsidiaries are only one investment in a diversified 
portfolio that includes energy services, telecommunications, and oil-field 
and mining support. We also interviewed four corporations that do not 
participate in the 8(a) program, relying instead on telecommunications, 
real estate, tourism, natural resources, and other investments. 

The ANCs we reviewed do not track the benefits provided to their 
shareholders specifically generated from 8(a) activity. Thus, an explicit 
link between the revenues generated from the 8(a) program and benefits 
provided to shareholders is not documented. However, ANCs do track 
benefits generated from their consolidated revenue sources. Benefits vary 
among corporations, but include dividend payments, scholarships, 
internships, burial assistance, land gifting or leasing, shareholder hire, 
cultural programs, and support of the subsistence lifestyle. For more 
information on benefits, see appendix X. 

We found that sizable 8(a) revenues do not guarantee a higher level of 
shareholder benefits, as two of the five ANCs that account for most of the 
8(a) ANC dollars obligated from fiscal years 2000 to 2004 demonstrate. 

 One corporation, which provides sizable benefits, credits the 8(a) 
program with its continued existence, its return to profitability after 
declaring bankruptcy, and its ability to provide monetary benefits. In 

Page 24 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

the early 1990s, the corporation was required to pay off its debts before 
paying any dividends.21 Its board and management attribute its return to 
profitability to its heavy participation in the 8(a) program. By 2004, the 
ANC paid out dividend amounts that were among the highest of all 
regional corporations. An original shareholder owning 100 shares, for 
example, received $3,500 in dividends in 2004. The ANC also provided a 
number of other benefits to its shareholders, their spouses and 
descendants, such as scholarships and a business assistance program. 
 

 In contrast, another ANC with a high level of activity in the 8(a) 
program is currently unable to provide a comparable level of monetary 
benefits. This corporation encountered a few years of heavy losses due 
to lawsuits and management malfeasance. Since being in financial 
recovery for the past 5 years, it has not been allowed to issue dividends 
to shareholders.22 However, it provides other benefits, such as 
scholarships and protection of land and subsistence rights for its 
shareholders. 

 
We also found that a high level of benefits can exist even if an ANC is not 
participating in the 8(a) program at all. For example, at the time of our 
review, one regional corporation received all of its revenues from its 
diverse non-8(a) investments, including real estate, natural resources, 
telecommunications, tourism, golf resorts, casino gaming, construction, 
and oil-field services. From 2000 to 2004, this corporation provided 
dividend payments that were substantially higher than any others we 
reviewed and also provided a number of additional types of benefits to its 
shareholders. 

 
Key Practice Is Creation of 
Multiple 8(a) Subsidiaries 

To generate revenue, many ANCs own multiple businesses in the 8(a) 
program, taking advantage of their special ability to do so. Many of the 
subsidiaries have offices that are located outside of Alaska, which is not 
prohibited by statute or regulation. As Figure 6 demonstrates, the number 
of 8(a) ANC subsidiaries has increased markedly.

Year

Number of ANCs owning subsidiaries in 8(a) program
Number of ANC subsidiaries in 8(a) program

Number

 

As of December 2005, 49 ANCs owned a total of 154 8(a) firms and  
30 ANCs owned more than one 8(a) firm. See appendix IX for a listing of 
these 49 ANCs. The corporation owning the most subsidiaries had a total 
of 14 active or graduated 8(a) subsidiaries. The five corporations that 
represented the largest volume of 8(a) ANC dollars from 2000 to 2004 
owned a total of 45 active and exited 8(a) subsidiaries, or 24 percent of the 
total. Regional corporations have been more active than the village and 
urban corporations in forming multiple subsidiaries.23 

SBA’s 8(a) regulation requires that the subsidiaries of each ANC be 
certified in the 8(a) program under a different primary NAICS code, 
representing different lines of business. However, the 8(a) businesses can 
pursue work in an unlimited number of secondary NAICS codes, 
regardless of their primary line of work declared at the time they apply to 
the 8(a) program. This means that an 8(a) subsidiary of an ANC may 

                                                                                                                                    
23None of the group corporations participated in the 8(a) program at the time of this report.  

Page 26 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

pursue government contracts under any of its primary or secondary 
NAICS codes, including those that overlap with the secondary NAICS code 
of another 8(a) subsidiary owned by the same parent corporation. 

ANCs use their ability to own multiple businesses in the 8(a) program, as 
allowed by law, in different ways. The following table summarizes some of 
the practices we identified in our interviews with ANCs and our review of 
their documentation. 

Page 27 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

Table 4: Pract ices Pert aining to Ow ning Mu ltiple Su bsidiaries  

Practic es AN Cs ar e using Our observations 
Own multiple subsidiaries with overlapping 
NAICS codes, either as a primary or 
secondary line of business.  

Six of seven 8( a) subsidiaries of one corporation marketed their ability to perform work 
under the same NAICS code for facilities support services, either as the primary or 
secondary NAI CS code for each subsidiary. Appendix XI pr ovides an exa mple.  

Lever age the ex pertise and management 
from existing s ubsidiaries to aid with the 
development of the newer subsidiaries.  

One corporation shared staff and management between its older and newer 8(a) 
subsidiaries. Additionally, the two subsidiaries market themselves together on one 
website. 
Officials from one ANC told us it had an 8(a) ANC firm with only 2 employees. 
Nevertheless, the firm had leveraged the ex pertise and management of other 
subsidiaries owned by the ANC to be in a position to enter negotiations with NASA for a 
$30 mil lion sole-source contract. 

Create a second subsidiary to win follow-on 
work from a graduating subsidiary. 

One corporation created a second subsidiary in anticipation of its first one’s grad uation 
from the 8(a) program. The newer firm successfully obtained a sole-source follow-on 
contract that the original subsidiary had performed. 
In another exa mple, an ANC subsidiary had an 8(a) contract that was expir ing, yet the 
subsidiary was graduating from the 8(a) program. Based o n its experi ence with this 
ANC firm, the government agency awarded a $21 mi llion follow-on contract to a 
different subsidiary of the same ANC. 

Some ANCs wholly own their 8(a) 
subsidiaries, while others invest in partially-
owned subsidiaries.a 
 

Of the 26 ANCs we reviewed that were active in the 8(a) program, 13 wholly-owned all 
of their 8(a) subsidiaries and 13 partially-owned at least one 8(a) subsidiary. 
Some ANCs shared ownership of 8(a) subsidiaries with other ANCs. Other corporations 
shared ownership with subsidiary executiv es. For example, one corporation owns 56 
percent of its 8(a) subsidiary, and the subsidiary executiv es, who were not Alaska 
Natives, retain 44 percent of profits. 

Some ANCs own subsidiaries that specializ e 
in a niche market with the goal of developing 
an independently sustainable business.  

Two corporations we interviewed said they take this specialized a pproach, rather than 
creating individual subsidiaries with multiple capabilities. Bo th corporations noted that 
the intent of the 8(a) program is business development. 
One corporation’s subsi diaries specialize i n aircraft maintenance and niche 
manufacturing, with the intent of reducing future competition and increasing the 
potential for long-term success past graduation from the 8(a) program. 

Other ANCs diversify their subsidiaries’ 
capabilities to increase opportunities to win 
government contracts in various industries. 

One subsidiary marketed its abilities to perform work in construction, landscaping, 
manufacturing, computer and software wholesaling, engineering, management 
consulting, research and development, and administrative services. 
Some corporations stated that they diversified their subsidiaries’ cap abilities in 
response to requests from agencies to perform work that was outside the companies’ 
original focus.

a
 To be eligible for the special provisions for ANCs in the 8(a) program, an ANC must be the majority 

owner of the business. The minority owners receive a percentage of the profits the subsidiary 
generates based on ownership arrangements. 

 

According to SBA data, 36 ANC firms exited the 8(a) program from 1998 
through 2005. Eleven subsidiaries exited because they completed their  
9-year term in the program. The remaining 25 subsidiaries exited the 

Page 28 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

program before completing the full 9-year term. Of these, seven graduated 
early from the program after exceeding SBA’s size standards for revenue 
or number of employees. Though no longer 8(a) participants, these 
subsidiaries are obligated to continue to perform work on previously 
awarded 8(a) contracts, including any priced options that may be 
exercised. Another subsidiary lost its 8(a) status after failing to file 
paperwork with SBA. Other subsidiaries dissolved, became inactive, or 
were sold to other businesses. 

 
ANCs Pursue Other 8(a) 
Business Strategies 

We found a variety of other strategies that ANCs use to generate revenue, 
as discussed below. 

 

Although all of the ANCs that we reviewed retained a board composed 
entirely of Alaska Natives, several have recruited outside executives who 
are not Alaska Natives to manage the parent corporation or their 8(a) 
operations. Some corporations recruited these executives for their specific 
experience in the 8(a) program, which they gained working on other 
government contracts or in operations at other 8(a) ANC subsidiaries. 
Some corporation executives stated that this managerial expertise was a 
key factor to success in the 8(a) program. For example, representatives 
from one corporation told us that its 8(a) subsidiary suffered after its 
executive left to work at another ANC. Some of these managers command 
salaries significantly higher than those of the executives at the parent 
corporation. For example, in 2004, a corporation paid one of its chief 
executive officers for 8(a) operations almost $1 million — more than three 
times as much as the highest-paid executive of the parent corporation. 

Relying on Outside Expertise 

Additionally, a few ANCs hire outside marketing firms to assist them with 
securing contracts. One such firm provides services such as locating 
potential contracts for its ANC client, interviewing potential partners on 
the project, meeting with contracting agencies, and following up with the 
contracting officer after award. 

Another business strategy is to create partnerships with individuals or 
other businesses to gain access to capital, experience, or expertise. For 
example, one corporation entered into a partnership by sharing subsidiary 
ownership with another ANC when it did not have the necessary capital to 
create a new subsidiary. The other corporation benefited from the 
partnership because it was new to the 8(a) program and needed the other 
corporation’s experience. 

Creating Partnership 
Arrangements 

Page 29 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

In addition to ownership arrangements, many ANCs pursue other types of 
partnerships, such as joint ventures and mentor-protégé relationships, as a 
business strategy to better position themselves for federal contract 
opportunities through the 8(a) program. 

Joint venture agreements. A “joint venture” is an agreement between an 
8(a) participant and one or more businesses to work together on a specific 
8(a) contract.24 With SBA’s approval, an 8(a) subsidiary may enter into an 
unlimited number of joint venture agreements. Of the 26 corporations we 
interviewed that were participating in the 8(a) program, 22 owned 
subsidiaries that participated in a total of 57 joint venture agreements. In 
2001, a joint venture between two ANCs was awarded a $2.1 billion 
contract by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. 

Mentor-protégé agreements. SBA established the mentor-protégé program 
to encourage relationships between 8(a) businesses and other firms that 
act as mentors to provide technical, financial, and other assistance to their 
protégés.25 An 8(a) subsidiary may be a protégé to only one mentor at a 
time.26 Of the ANCs that we interviewed that were participating in the 8(a) 
program, 19 owned a total of 24 subsidiaries participating in mentor-
protégé agreements. 

 

ANCs create holding companies – non-8(a) subsidiaries that provide 
shared administrative services to other subsidiaries, for a fee – which also 
aid their participation in the 8(a) program. Of the 30 corporations we 
interviewed, 11 had formed holding companies. Two corporations had 
established three separate holding companies. 

Forming Holding Companies 

Figure 7 shows a sample ANC with a holding company for subsidiaries in 
and outside of the 8(a) program. 

                                                                                                                                    
24SBA’s regulations allow two or more businesses to joint venture on no more than three 
business ventures over 2 years. 

25Individual agencies, including Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, State, Transportation, 
and NASA, have their own mentor-protégé programs with slightly different guidelines.  

26However, a firm may mentor more than one 8(a) business at a time as long as the protégé 
firms are not competitors and the mentor firm is capable of handling multiple protégés. The 
SBA regulations note that generally, a mentor will have no more than one protégé at a time.

SBA requests that ANCs seek approval before forming a holding company, 
which must be wholly-owned by the parent ANC for the subsidiaries to be 
eligible for the 8(a) program. During the course of our review, we found 
one holding company that was 80-percent owned by the parent ANC and 
20-percent owned by two holding company executives. SBA’s records, 
however, showed the company as 100-percent owned by the parent ANC. 
A representative of the holding company told us that the ownership 
arrangement was changed after SBA’s initial approval of the holding 
company. The company did not notify SBA of the change because the 
holding company is not itself a participant in the 8(a) program and it 
wholly owns all of its subsidiaries, thereby maintaining compliance with 
the minimum 51-percent ownership requirement. SBA points to the statute 
and its regulations, which show that ANC 8(a) participants must be 
majority-owned by an ANC or a wholly-owned entity of an ANC. 
Therefore, subsidiaries under a partially-owned holding company are no 
longer eligible to participate in the 8(a) program. Since this situation came 
to light, the ANC and the holding company executives rescinded the  
20-percent ownership arrangement to maintain compliance with SBA 
requirements. Further, the SBA Alaska district office revised its template 
letter approving a change in ownership to clarify the restrictions on 
ownership of a holding company. 

ANC executives told us the benefits of holding companies included: 

 

Page 31 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

Greater efficiencies. The holding companies can provide accounting, 
human resources, legal, marketing, or other services, allowing the ANC to 
operate more efficiently. Since subsidiaries underneath the holding 
company do not need to perform these functions, they may employ fewer 
administrative staff and instead employ only technical staff. A lean staff is 
especially important since subsidiaries can become ineligible for the 8(a) 
program when they exceed a certain number of employees. 

Consistent policies and procedures. Some corporations established 
holding companies to facilitate consistent policies, procedures, and 
corporate governance across the subsidiaries. 

Easier administration. Corporation officials cited several administrative 
benefits to establishing holding companies, including the following 
examples: 

 The holding company’s smaller board allowed for faster decisions than 
assembling the parent corporation’s entire board. 

 Only one entity—the holding company—would be audited by the 
Defense Contract Audit Agency as opposed to each of the individual 
subsidiaries. 

 The holding company saved time on security clearances. For example, 
for a contract involving classified work, the holding company 
management and board of directors already had security clearances, 
saving the time of performing background checks on the corporation-
level management and board of directors. 

 
Coordination among subsidiaries. One corporation official told us that 
the holding company helps prevent competition among its subsidiaries for 
the same contracting opportunities. 

Legal protection. Representatives from two corporations stated that the 
holding company separates the parent company from most liability that a 
subsidiary may incur. For example, if the subsidiary went bankrupt, the 
parent corporation generally could not be held legally or financially 
responsible. 

 

Page 32 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

SBA has not tailored its policies and practices to account for ANCs’ unique 
status in the 8(a) program and growth in federal contracting, even though 
officials recognize that ANCs enter into more complex business 
relationships than other 8(a) participants. SBA officials told us that they 
have faced a challenge in overseeing the activity of the 8(a) ANC firms 
because ANCs’ charter under ANCSA is not always consistent with the 
business development intent of the 8(a) program. The officials noted that 
the goal of ANCs—economic development for Alaska Natives from a 
community standpoint—can be in conflict with the primary purpose of the 
8(a) program, which is business development for individual small, 
disadvantaged businesses.  
 
However, the officials agreed that improvements are needed in their 
oversight and said they are considering various actions in this regard. They 
told us that they are planning to revise their regulations and policies to 
address ANCs’ unique status in the 8(a) program. Moreover, they are now 
in the process of implementing a new, automated data collection tool to 
more readily collect information on 8(a) firms. It is expected to be 
operational during fiscal year 2007. 

 
SBA’s oversight has fallen short in that it does not 

 track the business industries in which ANC subsidiaries have 8(a) 
contracts to ensure that more than one subsidiary of the same ANC is 
not generating the majority of its revenue under the same primary

Program 

SBA Oversight of ANCs in 
the 8(a) Program Is Not 
Adequate  

 consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing 
contracting opportunities when large, sole-source contracts are 
awarded to 8(a) ANC firms; 

 adhere to a legislative and regulatory requirement to ascertain whether 
8(a) ANC firms, when entering the 8(a) program or for each contract 
award, have, or are likely to have, a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage within an industry; 

 ensure that partnerships between 8(a) ANC firms and large firms are 
functioning in the way they were intended under the 8(a) program; and 

 maintain information on ANC 8(a) activity. 
 
SBA officials from the Alaska district office reported to headquarters in 
the most recent quality service review that the make-up of their 8(a) 
portfolio is challenging and requires more contracting knowledge and 
business savvy than usual because the majority of the firms they oversee 
are owned by ANCs and tribal entities. The officials commented that these 
firms tend to pursue complex business relationships and tend to be 

Page 33 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

awarded large and often complex contracts. We found that the district 
office officials were having difficulty managing their large volume and the 
unique type of work in their 8(a) portfolio. When we began our review, 
SBA headquarters officials responsible for overseeing the 8(a) program did 
not seem aware of the growth in the ANC 8(a) portfolio and had not taken 
steps to address the increased volume of work in their Alaska office. 
 
As discussed above, ANCs can create multiple 8(a) subsidiaries that can be 
based across the United States. SBA’s Alaska district office, which is 
responsible for overseeing most 8(a) ANC contracting activity, does not 
track the business industries in which the subsidiaries win 8(a) contracts 
under secondary NAICS codes. Thus, SBA is not ensuring that a firm’s 
secondary NAICS codes do not, in effect, become the primary business 
line by generating the majority of revenue. This situation could allow an 
ANC to have more than one 8(a) subsidiary perform most of its work 
under the same primary NAICS code, which SBA regulation does not 
allow. Appendix XI shows an example of an ANC with subsidiaries 
marketing their ability to perform work in a number of different industries. 

Not Tracking Secondary Lines 
of Business across Multiple 
8(a) Firms Owned by One ANC 

Headquarters officials told us that they do not monitor the industries from 
which 8(a) participants receive revenue because they do not want to stifle 
the growth of the company. However, the officials acknowledged that they 
would be concerned if a subsidiary’s primary industry revenue source 
changed without SBA being notified. They have not developed a plan to 
increase monitoring of ANCs’ secondary NAICS codes, even though many 
of these firms take advantage of their ability to obtain contracts under 
secondary lines of business. 

We found cases where SBA did not take action when incumbent small 
businesses lost contract opportunities when an 8(a) ANC firm was 
awarded a large sole-source contract. For example: 

Not Consistently Determining 
Whether Other Small 
Businesses Are Losing Contract 
Opportunities 

 The Department of Transportation awarded an information technology 
contract to an 8(a) ANC firm in an effort to support transition to a 
single integrated infrastructure. According to the department’s 
acquisition plan, the goal is to create a more mission-effective, secure, 
and cost-effective computing environment that will provide common 
services. Previously, this service was being provided under separate 
contracts with eight small businesses. The consolidation project will 
likely discontinue the work performed by these small businesses and 
replace it with the single infrastructure managed by the 8(a) ANC firm. 
One of the incumbent small businesses protested the award to our 
agency. In its submission to our bid protest office, SBA acknowledged 

Page 34 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

that it had not conducted the required adverse impact analysis, but 
asserted that it had viewed the requirement as “new” and therefore had 
incorrectly concluded it was not required to perform the analysis. SBA 
also noted that the 8(a) regulation provides that, even where there is a 
presumption of adverse impact, SBA “may”—rather than “shall”—
determine whether adverse impact exists. SBA interprets this to mean 
that it has the discretion to accept a contract into the 8(a) program 
even where one of the contractors meets the presumption of adverse 
impact.27 
 

 The scope of an Air Force base contract with an ANC firm has been 
expanded as additional base civil engineering services, previously 
provided by small businesses, have been absorbed into the contract. 
Since the initial contract award, the estimated contract value has 
increased by $46 million to nearly $600 million. The contracting official 
coordinated these changes with SBA via e-mail. Rather than 
disapproving the request or evaluating the impact on other small 
businesses, SBA only expressed concern that the contracting officers 
were absorbing work into the contract that was well within the 
capability of other 8(a) contractors, indicating that it was “troubled” 
over the loss of a prime contracting opportunity for other small 
businesses. The contracting officer told us that the Air Force has now 
decided to stop adding services to the contract and will maintain the 
other existing small business contracts.  

 
When a procuring agency is interested in offering a requirement to a 
specific participant in the 8(a) program for a sole-source contract, the 
agency is required to send SBA an offering letter with information on the 
description of the work, the NAICS code, anticipated dollar value of the 
requirement, and the names and addresses of any small business 
contractors that have performed on the requirement during the previous 
24 months, among other things. At the time that SBA accepts a 
procurement for award into the 8(a) program, it is required to consider 
whether individual small businesses, a group of small businesses in a 
geographical area, or other business programs will be adversely 

                                                                                                                                    
27GAO ultimately denied the protest on the basis that GAO is required to give deference to 
an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its regulations and SBA’s analysis showed that the 
small business protestor would appear not to have met the requirements for presuming 
adverse impact. Catapult Technology, Ltd., B-294936, B-294936.2, January 13, 2005.  

Page 35 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

impacted.28 Adverse impact is determined to be present where, among 
other things, a small business has been performing the requirement 
outside the 8(a) program and this work represents 25 percent or more of 
its revenue.29 
 
In almost all cases for the 16 large sole-source contract we reviewed, 
SBA’s letters to the agencies approving the procurements contained 
boilerplate language: “a determination has been made that acceptance of 
this procurement will cause no adverse impact on another small business 
concern.” The language in the acceptance letters suggests that SBA 
conducted a formal adverse impact study, yet this was not the case for any 
of the contracts we reviewed. The letters do not clarify whether the 
determination was made based on a formal adverse impact study or 
whether no determination was required because the requirement was new 
or previously had been performed by a large business. SBA officials told us 
that the language is intended to encompass all situations where there is no 
adverse impact. 

SBA officials stated that it is difficult for them to ensure that other small 
businesses are not negatively affected because they are relying on the 
procuring agency to provide the procurement history, and, in their view, 
procuring agencies are not always forthcoming. During our review, the 
Alaska district office revised its standard letter to agencies to state that the 
adverse impact determination was made based on the procurement history 
the agency provided to SBA in its letter offering the procurement to the 
8(a) program. The letter also now states that the determination that 
acceptance of the procurement will cause no adverse impact on another 
small business was made on the basis of the agency’s identifying the 
requirement as new or not identifying an incumbent contractor. 

 

                                                                                                                                    
28If the requirement was already being performed under an 8(a) contract or is considered a 
new requirement, SBA is not required to perform the adverse impact study. SBA is 
required, under certain circumstances, to consider that adverse impact may exist if the 
requirement is a consolidation of work previously performed by small businesses.  

29The other requirements are that the small business concern must have performed the 
requirement for at least 24 months and is currently performing the requirement or finished 
performing within 30 days of the offering into the 8(a) program.  

Page 36 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

The Small Business Act states the following Failing to Determine 
Substantial Unfair Competitive 
Advantage In determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and 

economically disadvantaged Indian tribe30 (or wholly owned business entity of 

such tribe) each firm’s size shall be independently determined without regard to 
its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other 
business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that 
one or more such tribally owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to 
obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.31 

SBA has incorporated this language into its 8(a) regulation, but is not 
making the determinations that these business concerns have obtained, or 
are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage. In fact, the 
agency has no procedure in place to make these determinations. Officials 
told us that the language in the statute is confusing and that they are not 
sure how to implement it. They had not taken steps to obtain clarification 
and make any needed revisions to the 8(a) regulation or their standard 
operating procedures. SBA officials noted that the amount of participation 
by ANCs in the federal contracting market is so minimal when compared 
to all other businesses that they do not expect an ANC would have a 
substantial unfair competitive advantage in one industry. 

 

SBA is required to approve partnerships between 8(a) and other firms, 
such as mentor-protégé and joint venture arrangements, to ensure the 
agreements are fair and equitable and will be of substantial benefit to the 
8(a) concern. Where SBA concludes that an 8(a) concern brings very little 
to the joint venture relationship in terms of resources and expertise other 
than its 8(a) status, SBA regulations state that SBA will not approve the 
joint venture agreement. SBA officials told us that they work closely with 
the partnership firms to ensure that the 8(a) company has control in the 
joint venture and will be gaining from the relationship. Further, SBA’s 
regulations state that SBA will not approve a mentor-protégé relationship 
that it determines is merely a vehicle to enable a non-8(a) participant to 
receive 8(a) contracts. 

Not Ensuring That Partnerships 
between ANCs and Large Firms 
Operate As Intended 

                                                                                                                                    
30Indian tribe in this case is defined to include ANCs. 

3115 U.S.C. § 636(j)(10)(J)(ii)(II). 

Page 37 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

We found indications that oversight of these partnership relationships, 
particularly in the context of ANCs’ unique provisions and large 
businesses that want to take advantage of those provisions, may not be 
adequate. For example, representatives from an ANC firm told us that its 
mentor firm exploited it for its 8(a) status. In pursuit of a particular 
contract, the Alaska-based subsidiary invested in an office and staff in 
Arkansas at the advice of its mentor. When the contract was not won, the 
mentor deserted the protégé, and the subsidiary was left to search for 
federal work on its own in Arkansas. 

ANC firms in the 8(a) program provide information to SBA on their 
partnership arrangements as part of the annual review process, and SBA is 
reliant on this information to assess the partnerships’ success. Therefore, 
SBA may not obtain all necessary information to determine if the 
partnership is working as intended, even though SBA has primary 
responsibility to monitor these arrangements.32 

We found examples where the procuring agency had concerns about a 
partnership situation, but did not report its concerns to SBA, nor did SBA 
ever inquire whether the partnership was working as intended. 

 A State Department program official told us that his office had good 
intentions when it identified a joint venture between an 8(a) ANC firm 
and a large firm for a sole-source 8(a) award of an international 
construction services contract. In line with the business development 
aspect of SBA’s mentor protégé program, the State Department official 
had envisioned that the ANC firm would gain construction experience 
from the globally recognized larger partner and then compete on its 
own for other construction work at the State Department. However, 
the official, who was also the contracting officer representative, 
expressed concern that all the actual construction work was being 
subcontracted out and the joint venture was only doing construction 
management, which was not the intent when the requirement was 
offered to the 8(a) program. Moreover, in an e-mail to the contracting 
officer, this official suggested that the contractor had some 
performance problems and may have been circumventing the prices 
negotiated in the contract by using subcontracts for all the work. The 
program official never made these concerns known to SBA, nor did 
SBA ever inquire whether the partnership was working as intended. 

                                                                                                                                    
32SBA can request additional information from the participant as it deems necessary as part 
of its annual review.  

Page 38 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

According to State Department officials, the contracting officer looked 
into the matter and found the concerns were unfounded. 

 
 In another example at the State Department, officials had some 

concerns that the 8(a) ANC firm was a front company for the large 
business in a joint venture for another construction project. In 
response to the concerns, representatives from the joint venture 
presented information to State officials on the role of the ANC firm, 
stating that it was involved with management from top to bottom and 
that the large firm would provide construction expertise where needed. 
We found no evidence that State officials contacted SBA about this 
issue at the time. 

 
SBA recognizes that the mentor-protégé aspect of the 8(a) program can be 
an important component of the overall business development of small 
businesses. However, officials believe that joint ventures between mentors 
and their protégés may be inappropriate for 8(a) sole-source contracts 
above competitive thresholds set for other 8(a) firms. SBA cites 
complaints that non-8(a) firms have received substantial benefits through 
the performance of large sole-source 8(a) contracts as joint venture 
partners with tribally-owned and 8(a) ANC firms. Further, where the joint 
venture involves a large business mentor, SBA recognizes a perception 
that large businesses may be unduly benefiting from the 8(a) program. 

SBA lacks adequate data regarding the 8(a) program in general and does 
not collect any information on ANCs’ 8(a) activity. SBA could not provide 
us with reliable data for ANC revenues in the 8(a) program, even though 
all program participants are required to report this information annually. 
An SBA official explained that the district offices stopped using the 
database that collects this information and therefore the agency had no 
recent data on 8(a) participants’ revenues. Overall, data on ANC 8(a) 
contracting activity were not readily available. There is no mechanism in 
place for agencies to code 8(a) awards to ANCs in FPDS, for example. 

Not Collecting Information on 
ANC Participation 

 
The complex nature of some ANCs’ 8(a) business practices, combined 
with the competing ANCSA and 8(a) program goals of economic 
development for Alaska Natives versus development of individual small 
businesses, create the need for SBA to tailor its regulations and policies as 
well as to provide greater oversight in practice. Furthermore, since 
agencies can contract directly with ANC firms, they too have responsibility 
to ensure that these firms are operating in the program as intended. 

Conclusion 

Page 39 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

Without this level of oversight, there is clearly the potential for unintended 
consequences or abuse. 

 
We recommend that the Administrator of SBA take the following five 
actions when revising relevant regulations and policies: 

• Ascertain and then clearly articulate in regulation how SBA will 
comply with existing law to determine whether and when one or more 
ANC firms are obtaining, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair 
competitive advantage in an industry. 

Recommendations for 
Executive Action 

• In regulation, specifically address SBA’s role in monitoring ownership 
of ANC holding companies that manage 8(a) operations to ensure that 
the companies are wholly owned by the ANC and that any changes in 
ownership are reported to SBA. 

• Collect information on ANCs’ 8(a) participation as part of required 
overall 8(a) monitoring, to include tracking the primary revenue 
generators for 8(a) ANC firms to ensure that multiple subsidiaries 
under one ANC are not generating their revenue in the same primary 
industry. 

• Revisit regulation that requires agencies to notify SBA of all contract 
modifications and consider establishing thresholds for notification, 
such as when new NAICS codes are added to the contract or there is a 
certain percentage increase in the dollar value of the contract. 

 Once notification criteria are determined, provide guidance to 
the agencies on when to notify SBA of contract modifications 
and scope changes. 
 

• Consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing 
contracting opportunities when awarding contracts through the 8(a) 
program to ANC firms. 

We also recommend that the Administrator of SBA take the following five 
actions to improve practices pertaining to SBA’s oversight. 

• Standardize approval letters for each 8(a) procurement to clearly 
assign accountability for monitoring of subcontracting and for 
notifying SBA of contract modifications. 

Page 40 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

• Tailor wording in approval letters to explain the basis for adverse 
impact determinations. 

• Clarify MOUs with procuring agencies to state that it is the agency 
contracting officer’s responsibility to monitor compliance with the 
limitation on subcontracting clause. 

• Evaluate staffing levels and training needed to effectively oversee ANC 
participation in the 8(a) program and take steps to allocate appropriate 
resources to the Alaska district office. 

• Provide more training to agencies on the 8(a) program, specifically 
including a component on ANC 8(a) participants. 

To ensure that agencies are properly overseeing ANC 8(a) contracts, we 
recommend that the Secretaries of the Departments of Defense, Energy, 
Homeland Security, the Interior, State, and Transportation and the 
Administrator of NASA take the following action: 

• Work with SBA to develop guidance to agency contracting officers 
on how to comply with requirements of the 8(a) program such as 
limitations on subcontracting and notifying SBA of contract 
modifications, particularly when contracting with 8(a) ANC firms. 

 
We provided a draft of this report to the departments of Defense, Energy, 
Homeland Security, Interior, State, and Transportation and to NASA and 
SBA. We received written comments from SBA, Homeland Security, the 
Interior, NASA, State, and Energy. We received official oral comments 
from Defense and Transportation. We also received written comments 
from the Native American Contractors Association. The written comments 
we received are included as appendixes II through VIII. 

Agency Comments 
and Our Evaluation 

In its written comments, SBA took issue with several aspects of the report. 
Its letter did not indicate whether or not it plans to implement the 
recommendations we made, but in a subsequent email the agency 
expressed disagreement with several of them. SBA’s comments and our 
views on them follow. 

• The agency referred to the concerns we raise as “subjective” and 
stated that our analysis relies “far too heavily on isolated individual 
anecdotes” to support findings and recommendations pertaining to 
8(a) ANC activity. We strongly disagree with this characterization. 

Page 41 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

Our findings are supported by the facts we gathered and our 
analysis of regulations, policies, contract files, ANC annual reports, 
FPDS and agency data, and other relevant documentation, as well 
as interviews with agency contracting officers and acquisition 
officials, SBA officials in headquarters and the Alaska district 
office, and representatives of 30 ANCs. The findings we developed 
and the shortcomings in oversight we found directly support the  
10 recommendations we make to SBA. Further, it is an undisputed 
fact that there has been significant growth in federal dollars 
awarded to 8(a) ANC firms in recent years, as recognized by SBA 
in its comment letter. Clearly, 6 of the 7 procuring agencies in our 
review--which account for most of the government’s 8(a) dollars to 
ANC firms--agree that there is a need for them to work with SBA to 
develop guidance for contracting officers in light of the unique 
procurement advantages Congress has provided 8(a) ANC firms.  

• SBA believes that our report should cite federal dollars to women-
owned and other small business categories and the government’s 
achievement of small business goals in general. That information is 
not relevant to this report. Our review focused specifically on ANC 
activity in the 8(a) program, as set forth in appendix I, which 
outlines our scope and methodology. 

• SBA states that it has recently taken a number of steps to improve 
oversight of the 8(a) program, including taking into consideration 
special provisions afforded to 8(a) ANC firms, Native Hawaiian 
Organizations, and Indian tribes. It is unclear what steps SBA is 
referring to. While we note in our report that SBA officials told us 
they were planning to revise regulations and policies, we were not 
provided with any evidence that this or any other planned action 
had been taken, despite our requests for the information.  

• SBA states that it is “conjecture” to make recommendations 
pertaining to data on 8(a) ANC activity until the lack of data 
explaining 8(a) participants’ economic activities, including ANC 
firms, is resolved. Our recommendation on data collection is 
intended to address this very gap. It is directed at SBA because that 
agency is responsible for managing the 8(a) program. We found 
that SBA lacked adequate data on the 8(a) program in general and 
was not collecting any information on ANC firms’ activity 
specifically. 

Page 42 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

• SBA pointed out that the statutory language refers to “substantial” 
unfair competitive advantage, a change we have made to the 
report. SBA found our focus on this issue unreasonable, stating 
that all 8(a) participants have been accorded a competitive 
advantage. During our review, it was clear that SBA had in place no 
policy or procedure to make unfair competitive advantage 
determinations. We do not understand how SBA can ignore the fact 
that Congress has directed it to make these determinations 
specifically for ANC firms in the 8(a) program.  

• SBA refers to the tone of our report as “unsettling” and suggests 
that it could lead readers to conclude that we have concerns with 
the fact that agencies can count 8(a) ANC contracts toward their 
federal small business goals. We express no concerns of the kind. 
Rather, our concerns, as reflected in the recommendations to SBA, 
pertain to the level of oversight it is exercising over 8(a) ANC 
activity. 

• In an e-mail sent after the comment letter, SBA expressed 
disagreement with several of the recommendations but did not 
address the others. It stated that its annual reviews track 
ownership changes and the business mix of all 8(a) participants 
and that its regulations require contracting officers to report 
contract modifications. These comments are not responsive to our 
recommendations. Our recommendations specifically discuss 
monitoring ownership of ANC holding companies, tracking primary 
revenue generators across 8(a) ANC subsidiaries, and establishing 
thresholds for notification of 8(a) contract modifications. SBA 
disagreed with the recommendation on determining whether other 
small businesses are losing contracting opportunities, stating that 
it already does so for all 8(a) sole-source offerings. As illustrated 
by the examples in our report, this is not the case.  

SBA’s written comments are included as appendix II. 

The Department of Homeland Security agreed with the recommendation 
affecting it and indicated it would partner with SBA to ensure that the 
department’s contracting officers have a thorough understanding of all 
contracting regulations on awarding contracts under SBA’s 8(a) program. 
Homeland Security requested that we reflect that the department has only 
been in existence since 2003 and that FPDS data would not be available 
for the 5-year period. We agreed and added this point to our explanation of 
why we did not include the department in our trend analysis. In addition, 

Page 43 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

the department stated that, in providing us a list of contracts awarded to 
firms with the DUNS numbers we provided, officials did not indicate that 
it included all contracts awarded to ANC firms. Homeland Security 
attempted to reconcile the identified missing contracts from the list of 
contracts awarded to ANCs; however, we still determined that the 
agency’s data were inadequate to include in our trend analysis. Homeland 
Security’s written comments are included as appendix III. 

The Department of the Interior agreed with the recommendation affecting 
it and proposed that an interagency work group be established and headed 
by the SBA to develop guidance for contracting officers. The department 
also provided specific comments on the contract awarded to an ANC firm 
on behalf of DOD’s Counter Intelligence Field Activity (CIFA). The Interior 
Department said that the referenced contract was not awarded to the ANC 
firm “because CIFA…had requested that firm.” The evidence we gathered 
from the contract file, as well as interviews with the contracting officer 
and the ANC firm, support the facts as we have stated them. CIFA, through 
a preauthorization letter, had arranged with the ANC firm to provide a 
variety of urgently needed services and requested that GovWorks award 
the contract to that firm. Interior’s written comments are included as 
appendix IV.  

NASA agreed with the recommendation affecting it and indicated that it 
will work with the SBA to develop guidance and to provide whatever 
assistance SBA may need to address the recommendations directed to it. 
NASA’s written comments are included as appendix V.  

The State Department agreed with the recommendation affecting it, stating 
that it will work with the SBA to develop standardized guidance to 
contracting officers on monitoring limitations on subcontracting and SBA 
notification of contract modifications. The State Department noted that 
the contract negotiations involving an 8(a) ANC joint venture took place in 
a compressed acquisition cycle and that SBA was in direct contact with 
the venturing parties at the time they were negotiating the contract. State 
concludes that because of SBA’s “simultaneous interaction” with the 
venturing parties and with State’s contracting officer, a formal request for 
SBA intervention would have been superfluous. However, our discussion 
focuses on the concerns about the extent of work being performed by the 
8(a) ANC firm versus that of its joint venturing partner. These issues were 
raised within the State Department several months after the contract was 
awarded, and SBA was not notified at that time. The department also 
suggested some technical changes, which we incorporated as appropriate. 
The department’s written comments are included as appendix VI. 

Page 44 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
 
 

The Department of Energy did not comment on the recommendation. It 
stated that our report gives the impression that agencies rely 
“significantly” on the ANC program to achieve small business goals. Our 
report does not state or imply that. Rather, we note that contracting 
officers have turned to 8(a) ANC firms as a way to help them meet their 
goals. The department also pointed to a perceived inconsistency in the 
report dealing with the “limitations on subcontracting” clause as it 
pertains to construction contracts. We disagree; the section in the report 
on this matter clearly establishes that the limitation for construction 
contracts is different than for other services. Energy’s written response is 
included as appendix VII. 

In official oral comments, DOD agreed with the recommendation, stating 
that the development of additional guidance by the department to ensure 
the effective oversight of 8(a) ANC contracts is necessary and that the 
department will work closely with SBA to develop this guidance. DOD 
added that, prior to commencement of these efforts, it is imperative that 
SBA undertake the actions we recommended for revising its relevant 
regulations and policies and improving its oversight practices concerning 
8(a) ANC contracts, as these changes will form the basis of the new or 
expanded DOD-specific guidance. 

In official oral comments, the Department of Transportation agreed with 
the recommendation. Transportation also provided some technical 
comments that we incorporated as appropriate. 

We also received written comments from the Native American Contractors 
Association. The association believes that we should more fully 
acknowledge the legal and policy basis of 8(a) program rules for Native 
Entities. We believe the report thoroughly explains the legislative basis for 
8(a) ANC firms’ procurement provisions and that it sets forth the rules for 
ANC firms as compared to those for other 8(a) firms. The association also 
raised several broader issues that impact the entire federal procurement 
system that it believes we should have included, such as in the areas of 
contract bundling, acquisition workforce, improper counting toward small 
business goals, and modifications to contract scope. While these are areas 
that we have reported on in the past, the focus of this audit was on 8(a) 
ANC contracting. Contrary to the association’s assertion, we do place 
certain findings—particularly with regard to the limitations on 
subcontracting and notification to SBA of contract modifications—in the 
context of the 8(a) program in general. For example, our 
recommendations to SBA on these issues are not limited solely to 8(a) 
ANC contracting activity. In technical comments provided separately, the

association suggested that, for context, we include reference to total 
federal procurement spending on goods and services. We have added this 
information as a note to figure 3. The association’s comments are included 
as appendix VIII.

Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 
 Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 

We conducted our work at the Small Business Administration (SBA), 
including its national headquarters and district office in Anchorage, 
Alaska; the Departments of Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, the 
Interior; State, and Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA). We traveled to Alaska and met with 
representatives of 30 Alaska Native corporations (ANC). We also met with 
representatives of the Native American Contractors Association in 
Washington, D.C. and interviewed officials from a number of small 
businesses as well as representatives from an 8(a) association. We 
reviewed relevant legislation, including the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (ANSCA) for background on the ANC corporate structure 
and the Small Business Act and other relevant legislation to understand 
the pertinent procurement advantages that ANC firms receive in the 8(a) 
program. 

To identify overall trends in the government’s contracting with ANCs, we 
obtained data from the Federal Data Procurement System (FPDS) for 
fiscal years 2000 through 2004. To gather data on federal 8(a) contracting 
with ANCs, we identified each ANC firm’s Data Universal Numbering 
System (DUNS) number and used this information to obtain data from 
FPDS and agencies. To assess the reliability of the procurement data used 
in our 5-year trend analysis, we (1) compared FPDS and agency data to 
verify the accuracy of the data; (2) reviewed related documentation, 
including contract files; and (3) worked closely with agency officials to 
identify and resolve any data problems. When we found discrepancies, we 
brought them to the agency’s attention and worked with them to correct 
the discrepancies before conducting our analyses. We determined that the 
data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We had 
planned to include Homeland Security in our trend analysis, but did not do 
so for two reasons. First, since FPDS only includes Homeland Security 
contract data for part of fiscal year 2003 and beyond, we were unable to 
confirm the reliability of the data for the purposes of our 5-year trend 
analysis. Second, we found that the data from Homeland Security were 
inconsistent and therefore questioned the reliability of the data overall. 
For example, the data provided did not include contracts awarded by 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement and contained other data errors, 
such as contracts recorded with either an incorrect dollar value or as sole 
source when awarded competitively.  

To assess the trends in government 8(a) sole-source contracting with 
ANCs from fiscal years 2000 to 2004, we reviewed data from the six federal 
agencies that, according to FPDS, comprise about 85 percent of total 
federal dollars obligated to ANCs via the 8(a) program. These agencies 

Page 48 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 
 

were the departments of Defense, Energy, the Interior, State, and 
Transportation and NASA, which obligated about $2.5 billion in sole- 
source contracts to ANCs for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. To 
understand the facts and circumstances surrounding specific contract 
awards, we reviewed contract files, interviewed agency contracting 
officers, and reviewed any relevant bid protests for 16 large dollar value, 
sole-source 8(a) contracts at seven agencies. Whereas we included six 
agencies in our 8(a) sole source trend analysis, we added the Department 
of Homeland Security to our contract file review. To identify two sole-
source contracts awarded by Homeland Security, we began reviewing the 
contracts with the largest dollar awards from the data provided, but had to 
exclude a number of the largest contracts from our file review due to 
errors in the data. We brought significant data errors to the attention of 
Homeland Security officials and the department stated that it has initiated 
corrective action. For the seven agencies, we selected contracts based on 
high ultimate award values and high dollars obligated to date that 
represented a variety of contractors and services. We made the initial 
contract selections based on the available data at that time. 

To assess how ANCs use the 8(a) program, we reviewed documentation 
and spoke with representatives from 30 Alaska Native corporations—all  
13 regional and 17 selected village or urban corporations—and some of 
their 8(a) subsidiaries. In selecting corporations to interview, we 
considered diversity in geography, financial strategy and profitability, and 
participation in the 8(a) program. Tables 5 and 6 show the corporations 
included in our review.

Additionally, we visited seven villages with populations that had a high 
percentage of Alaska Natives to understand the lifestyle and livelihood of 
the Alaska Native people. We selected these villages based on diversity in 
geography, population, average per capita income, and shareholder culture 
and history. We also attended a shareholders’ annual meeting at one of 
these villages to observe communication and relations between 
shareholders and corporate management. Table 7 shows the villages we 
visited.

To understand the structure, shareholder population, and involvement in 
the 8(a) program of each corporation, we examined annual reports and 
other documentation from our selected 30 corporations and spoke with 
Alaska Native shareholders. We also interviewed ANC executives on 

Page 51 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 
 

corporate governance, strategies for participation in the 8(a) program, and 
benefits provided to shareholders. Additionally, we met with executives at 
selected subsidiaries participating in the 8(a) program to understand their 
structure, business strategies, and relationship to their parent 
corporations.  

To establish whether SBA’s oversight over ANCs in the 8(a) program is 
adequate, we reviewed relevant regulations and operating procedures to 
understand the requirements for oversight of the 8(a) program and of ANC 
8(a) activity. We interviewed SBA officials at the Alaska district office and 
reviewed relevant files to understand that staff’s oversight role and 
workload priorities. Finally, we analyzed documents from and spoke with 
SBA headquarters officials in the Washington, D.C. office to understand 
their oversight of district offices and the 8(a) program and whether the 
officials have assessed and addressed the impact of increased ANC activity 
on the 8(a) program.

Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 
Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 
 Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 

Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 

Through our review of documentation provided by the 13 regional and  
17 village or urban Alaska Native corporations (ANC) included in our 
review, as well as interviews with corporation representatives and 
shareholders, we gained an understanding of how the corporations 
communicate with and obtain input from their shareholders and of the 
benefits they provide.  

The ANCs communicated with their shareholders through surveys, Web 
sites, newsletters, annual reports, local media, shareholder committees, 
and annual and other periodic meetings. Some had “open door” policies, 
which gave shareholders the opportunity to voice their opinions to 
management at any time. Additionally, corporations took steps to reach 
out to shareholders both out of state and in the villages. For example, one 
corporation’s officials conducted the annual meeting via Web cast and 
noted that Internet attendance was beginning to outpace in-person 
attendance. Another corporation rotated its annual meeting among 
Anchorage, Seattle, and its regional hub. Additionally, several of the 
regional corporations regularly traveled to their villages to seek input. 
Steps taken by one to facilitate village outreach included moving the 
location of its annual meeting from the regional hub to the villages; 
holding the meeting in the native language; and investing in a boat to 
facilitate transport to the region’s villages. 

Shareholder preferences for benefits differed among corporations. For 
example, one corporation stated that its shareholders prioritized 
protection of their land and the subsistence lifestyle.1 Shareholders of 
other corporations placed a greater value on dividends, scholarships, 
training, and job opportunities. 

Corporations reported targeting benefits towards the needs of their 
shareholders. Such projects included 

 investing in low-cost Internet service as a tool to reduce the isolation of 
a particularly remote village; 

 issuing death benefits in the form of food vouchers because the 
cultural tradition among its shareholders is to host and feed visitors 
from the time of death through burial services; 

                                                                                                                                    
1 The subsistence lifestyle depends on wild resources for basic needs such as food, 
clothing, and fuel as well as for trade, arts, and ceremony.  

Page 80 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 
Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 
 

 investing in an insurance company when other insurance companies 
were reluctant to insure shareholders’ homes; and 

 subsidizing heating oil for residents of a small, remote community 
north of the Arctic Circle, absorbing a loss of $2.75-$3.00 per gallon. 
 

Some regional corporations stated that they required sizable revenues to 
provide benefits to a large shareholder base. Of the corporations we 
reviewed, the 13 regional corporations had approximately 102,000 
shareholders, and the 17 village and urban corporations had about  
17,000 shareholders.2 Overall, the corporations we reviewed saw a  
31 percent increase in their number of shareholders since incorporation.3 
The number of shareholders at two regional corporations more than 
doubled since incorporation. 

The 30 ANCs included in our review reported providing three categories of 
benefits 

 dividends, 
 other direct benefits, and 
 indirect benefits 

 
Dividends: In 2004, the 30 corporations paid a total of $121.6 million in 
dividends. Eleven corporations issued no dividends. Of the corporations 
that issued dividends, payments ranged from $1.71 per share to $171.00 per 
share. In a given year, a shareholder may have received a dividend from 
his or her village corporation and an additional dividend from his or her 
regional corporation. 

Corporate officials noted that dividend payments, no matter how small, 
meant much to their shareholders in many rural villages where basic 
necessities were expensive—for example, milk cost $12 per gallon and 
fuel cost $5 per gallon. 

Original shareholders received 100 shares upon incorporation. One village 
corporation’s 137 shareholders owned as few as one and up to 200 shares, 
with an average of about 50 shares.  

                                                                                                                                    
2Each eligible Alaska Native is generally entitled to membership both in the corporation 
established for his or her village and in the regional corporation in which the village is 
located.  

3 One corporation was unable to provide us with its original enrollment data.  

Page 81 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 
Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 
 

A third of the ANCs created permanent funds to build up a reserve for 
future dividends. Two corporations told us that these funds allowed them 
to issue dividends even in years when they were unprofitable. 

Half of the ANCs established policies specifying an amount or percentage 
of net income to be distributed as shareholder dividends. For example, 
one corporation’s board required an increase in its annual dividend 
amount by 10 percent over the previous year. Another corporation 
annually distributed 66 percent of its average net income for the prior  
5 years to shareholders. The result of this policy coupled with some 
unprofitable years was that in 2004, this ANC paid 100 percent of its 
income in dividends to shareholders. 

 Shareholder hiring preference and job opportunities. All of the 
corporations we interviewed reported a hiring preference for 
shareholders. Some corporations extended this preference to 
shareholders’ families, other Alaska Natives, and/or other Native 
Americans. 
 

Other Direct Benefits: 

 Other employment assistance programs. In addition to offering a 
shareholder hire preference, corporations made efforts to encourage 
other shareholder employment. Nine of the 30 corporations offered a 
management training program. Some corporations had agreements 
with partner companies encouraging shareholder hire. One corporation 
had a preference to conduct business with shareholder-owned 
businesses. Another corporation’s employment assistance programs 
included mentoring; one-on-one counseling; business and career fairs; 
survey of shareholders over 18 seeking employment; and tracking 
shareholder employment status and interests in a database. 
 

 Benefits for elder shareholders. Twelve of the 30 corporations we 
interviewed reported issuing benefits for elder shareholders. Some 
corporations paid additional regular dividends to elders, while others 
made one-time financial payments. Two corporations made in-kind 
benefits for elders, such as a lunch program or a bus service. 
 

 Scholarships. Almost all corporations offered scholarships for 
shareholders. 
 

 Internships and other youth programs. Many corporations provided 
internships or other youth programs for shareholders at parent and 
subsidiary companies. Two Washington, D.C.-based subsidiaries 
provided housing and other relocation assistance to their interns. 
Additionally, one corporation instituted the Young Adult Advisory 

Page 82 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 
Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 
 

Mentor program, which allows its youth to participate in the 
corporation. Corporate officials told us that they instituted mentoring 
and internship programs to lead to future involvement of shareholders 
in management and leadership roles. 
 

 Burial assistance. Twenty-two of the 30 corporations reported 
providing some kind of assistance to the family of a deceased 
shareholder. Forms of burial assistance include cash, life insurance 
payments, or in-kind donations. 
 

 Land leasing, gifting or other use. Most of the village and urban 
corporations we interviewed leased, gifted, or made other use of the 
land given to the village corporation in the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act4 settlement for shareholders. For example, one 
corporation gifted five acres to any shareholder who requested it. 

 
 Community infrastructure. Several corporations invested in the 

infrastructure of their villages. For example, after the Department of 
the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs ceased barge service to its 
remote village, one corporation established a transportation company 
that became the only mechanism to bring goods to the community. 
Other projects included remodeling the community washateria5 and 
administering and subsidizing a village’s cable and Internet utilities. 

 
 Support of the subsistence lifestyle. Corporations took steps to protect 

and maintain the subsistence lifestyle of their shareholders. One 
corporation built in subsistence leave into its personnel policy. Another 
corporation leased its land for “fish camps,” or plots along a river for 
shareholders to catch and smoke fish in the summertime. 
 

Indirect Benefits: 

 Cultural preservation. Twenty-four of the 30 corporations we 
interviewed invested in cultural and heritage programs, which included 
museums, culture camps, or native language preservation. 
 

 Establishment and support of affiliated foundations or nonprofit 
organizations. Twenty-one of the 30 corporations established affiliated 
foundations or nonprofit organizations. 
 

                                                                                                                                    
4 Pub.L.92-203 (codified as amended in 43 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.). 

5A washateria is a community laundry and shower facility found in villages without running 
water.  

Page 83 GAO-06-399  Alaska Native Corporations 



 
Appendix X: Benefits That Alaska Native 
Corporations Provide to Their Shareholders 
 

 Donations to other nonprofit organizations. Almost all of the 
corporations donated to various nonprofit organizations. For example, 
one corporation donated to organizations that advocate for Alaska 
Natives, such as the Alaska Federation of Natives, Alaska Native Arts 
Foundation, Alaska Native Justice Center, and Get Out the Native Vote. 
 

 Support to other corporations. Some regional corporations provided 
various kinds of assistance to the village corporations in their regions. 
For example, one regional corporation is trying to develop 8(a) 
partnerships with its village corporations to help them enter the 8(a) 
program with lower start-up and administrative costs. Other regional 
corporations provided recordkeeping, natural resources, and 
regulatory and community planning services for their village 
corporations.

GAO’s Mission The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and 
investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its 
constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and 
accountability of the federal government for the American people. GAO 
examines the use of public funds; evaluates federal programs and policies; 
and provides analyses, recommendations, and other assistance to help 
Congress make informed oversight, policy, and funding decisions. GAO’s 
commitment to good government is reflected in its core values of 
accountability, integrity, and reliability.
