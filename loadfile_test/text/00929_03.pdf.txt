Agreement Regarding Confidential Information, Intellectual Property, and Other Matters
In consideration of my employment or my continued employment by International Business Machines Corporation or one of its
subsidiaries (collectively, “IBM”), which I acknowledge is employment at will, and the payment to me of a salary or other compensa-
tion during my employment, I agree as follows:
1. I will not, without IBM's prior written permission, disclose to anyone outside of IBM or use in other than IBM's business, either

during or after my employment, any confidential information or material of IBM, or any information or material received in confi-
dence from third parties, such as suppliers or customers, by IBM.  If I leave the employ of IBM, I will return to IBM all property in
my possession belonging to IBM or received from any third party by IBM, whether or not containing confidential information,
including, but not limited to, diskettes and other storage media, drawings, notebooks, reports, and other documents.
Confidential information or material of IBM is any information or material: (a) generated or collected by or utilized in the operations
of IBM, received from any third party, or suggested by or resulting from any task assigned to me or work performed by me for or
on behalf of IBM, and (b) which has not been made available generally to the public, whether or not expressed in a document or
other medium and whether or not marked "IBM Confidential" or with any similar legend of IBM or any third party.  Confidential
information or material may include, but is not limited to, information and material related to past, present and future development,
manufacturing activities, or personnel matters; marketing and business plans; technical specifications, drawings, and designs;
prototypes; computer programs; and databases.

2. I will not disclose to IBM, use in its business, or cause it to use, any information or material which is confidential to any third party
unless authorized by IBM.  In addition, I will not incorporate into any product used and/or sold by IBM, any copyrighted materials
of any third party, unless authorized by IBM.

3. I will comply, and do all things necessary for IBM to comply, (a) with the laws and regulations of all governments under which IBM
does business, (b) with provisions of contracts between any such government or its contractors and IBM that relate to intellectual
property or to the safeguarding of information, and (c) with all of the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines as amended from time to
time.

4. I hereby assign to IBM my entire right, title, and interest in any idea, concept, technique, invention, design (whether the design is
ornamental or otherwise), computer programs and related documentation, other works of authorship, mask works, and the like (all
hereinafter called "Developments"), hereafter made, conceived, written, or otherwise created solely or jointly by me, whether or
not such Developments are patentable, subject to copyright protection or susceptible to any other form of protection which: (a)
relate to the actual or anticipated business or research or development of IBM or its subsidiaries or (b) are suggested by or result
from any task assigned to me or work performed by me for or on behalf of IBM or its subsidiaries.  
In the case of any "other works of authorship", such assignment shall be limited to those works of authorship which meet both
conditions (a) and (b) above.

California Notice:  For Developments subject to California law, notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, I understand
that this assignment does not apply to a Development which qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the Califor-
nia Labor Code.

The above provisions concerning assignment of Developments apply to Developments created while I am employed by IBM in an
executive, managerial, professional, product or technical planning, technical, research, programming, or engineering capacity
(including development, product, manufacturing, systems, applied science, and field engineering).
Excluded are any Developments that I cannot assign to IBM because of prior agreement with 

which is effective until ________________________________ (Give name and date or write "none").
I acknowledge that the copyright and any other intellectual property right in designs, computer programs and related documenta-
tion, and other works of authorship, created within the scope of my employment, belong to IBM by operation of law.

5. In connection with any of the Developments assigned by Paragraph 4: (a) I will promptly disclose them in writing to the IBM Intel-
lectual Property Law Department; and (b) I will, on IBM's request, promptly execute a specific assignment of title to IBM or its
designee, and do anything else reasonably necessary to enable IBM or such designee to secure a patent, copyright or other form
of protection therefor in the United States and in other countries.  In addition, I agree to promptly notify the IBM Intellectual
Property Law Department in writing of any patent or patent application in which I am an inventor but which is not assigned by
Paragraph 4 and which discloses or claims any Development made, conceived, or written while I am employed by IBM.

6. IBM and its licensees, successors, or assigns (direct or indirect) are not required to designate me as an author of any Develop-
ment which is subject to Paragraph 4, when it is distributed, publicly or otherwise, or to secure my permission to change or other-
wise alter its integrity.  I hereby waive and release, to the extent permitted by law, all rights in and to such designation and any
rights I may have concerning modifications of such Developments.
I understand that any rights, waivers, releases, and assignments herein granted and made by me are freely assignable by IBM
and are for the benefit of IBM and its subsidiaries, licensees, successors, and assigns.
