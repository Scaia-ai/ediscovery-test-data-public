Susan,

Thank you for sending all those emails to the EWS-CCT address.  I noticed that the Ed Hlopak you sent the original emails to was the Ed, Sr - my father.  He used to work at EE&CC.

Have these files already been sent to E&Y?  If not, I'll get it done right away.

Regards,

Ed Hlopak
Sr. Project Manager
Enron Wholesale Services
