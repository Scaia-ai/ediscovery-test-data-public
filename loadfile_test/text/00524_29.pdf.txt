Team with Foxconn and IBM To Fight Asia Pacific Region’s 

Carbon Emissions 
Based in Taiwan, technology will serve as a new business model  

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 
 

DENVER and ARMONK, N.Y.-- March 4, 2009 – IBM, Enterprise Information 

Management Inc. (EIM), C-Lock Technology, Inc. (C-Lock™), a subsidiary of 

Evergreen Energy Inc. (NYSE Arca: EEE) and Foxconn/Hon Hai Technology Group 

today announced a global agreement to jointly deliver and deploy GreenCert™, the 

world’s first enterprise content management system that can accurately calculate and 

certify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by a facility.  

As part of the announcement, which took place in Tucheng, Taiwan, Foxconn and 

IBM will together bring the GreenCert technology to Taiwan, where it will serve as a 

new business model and an exclusive distribution source of GreenCert for the Asia 

Pacific region to promote energy saving, carbon reduction and other green energy 

opportunities.  

Today’s announcement marks the first time that GreenCert technology will be 

available in the Asia Pacific region. GreenCert is an information technology solution for 

environmental protection and energy production developed originally in the United States 

by IBM and its Business Partners, EIM and C-Lock. The solution combines technology 

from the IBM industry-leading software portfolio that includes WebSphere, DB2, Lotus, 

Tivoli and Rational.  

In addition to calculating carbon emissions, GreenCert provides instant data analysis 

and test reports that allow customers to use it as a base for carbon trading. Foxconn will 

make a significant investment leveraging IBM software and hardware technology to 

enable this analysis and management. At Kaohsiung Software Park, they will recruit 

several hundred software engineers with special industry skills to help make the

GreenCert technology system meet the specific needs of different Asian industries. 

Additionally, it will help enterprises in the Asia Pacific region realize their social 

responsibilities toward energy saving and carbonemissionsreduction. 

As the carbon trading market continues to gain strength, GreenCert is widely 

regarded as a driving force in saving energy and reducing carbon emissions. It is an 

important application for enterprises in industries such as power, petrochemicals, iron 

and steel and other energy businesses that attach great importance to the reduction of 

carbon dioxide emissions.  

The Kyoto Protocol promotes carbon trading as a key means of reducing worldwide 

emissions. Under the framework established by the Protocol, the amount of carbon 

emissions produced by a company will become a price tagged commodity to be traded on 

world markets under international law. This provision of the Protocol has proven to be 

very popular and, in fact, the World Bank’s “State and Trends of the Carbon Market 

2007,” pointed out that the use of carbon trading to encourage reduction of greenhouse 

gas emissions has become the most important international policy in reducing greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

“As part of this announcement, Foxconn will employ a large number of software 

engineers at the Kaohsiung Software Park to cultivate the talent needed to meet the 

increasing demand for environmental and energy saving technologies, and to deal with 

the global warming threat,” said Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn. “As the most preferred 

partner to all aspects of contract manufacturing, Foxconn firmly believes it is our duty to 

take action to help save energy, share our experience in reducing carbon dioxide and 

recycle.” 

“Our clients have identified a great need for accurate measurements in carbon trading. 

To meet this demand, IBM worked closely with EIM and C-Lock to develop GreenCert, 

which replaces manual calculation with computational technology.  This can help 

enterprises collect pollutant emission data and allow them to conduct carbon trading and 

follow environment protection rules in their countries,” said Mark Easton, vice president 

of IBM software sales. “Partnering with an environmentally conscious company like 

Foxconn in such a strategic way greatly enhances GreenCert’s ability to help enterprises 

in Asia Pacific reduce greenhouse gases.”
