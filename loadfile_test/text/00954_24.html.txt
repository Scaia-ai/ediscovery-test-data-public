The Model 5100 is IBM's first microcomputer, i.e. not a mainframe, and is also considered 
the world's first portable computer. Although at 55-pounds, it might best be described as 
"self-contained" rather than "portable". 




There were very few other computers available at the time, and nothing even close to the capabilities of the 5100. 
It is a very complete system - with a built-in monitor, keyboard, and data storage. It was also very expensive - 
up to US$20,000. It was specifically designed for professional and scientific problem-solvers, not business users 
or hobbyists. 








	

There are twelve different models of the 5100.


They were all rather expensive:
	Memory	Programming language
	 	APL	BASIC	Both
	16K	A1 - $8,975	B1 - $9,975	C1 - $10,975
	32K	A2 - $11,975	B2 - $12,975	C2 - $13,975
	48K	A3 - $14,975	B3 - $15,975	C3 - $16,975
	64K	A4 - $17,975	B4 - $18,975	C4 - $19,975



	

      







Depending on options installed, the 5100 can run the APL and/or BASIC programming languages.


What is APL? It is a programming language which used to be run only on mainframe computers (what else was there?)


Here are some links describing it:

Apparently, APL was a difficult task for IBM to accomplish with an interpreter in the 5100, so instead they 
wrote an emulation program so that the S/360 mainframe version of APL could be run instead -- 
The 5100 is like a desktop IBM S/360 mainframe computer which only runs APL.






Opening the 5100, you encounter an upside-down circuit board with thousands of sharp wires sticking straight up.



What are they? This is the bottom of the backplane in which all of the circuit board plug into.



Some jumpers can also be installed here for different configuration options.



As seen below, it swings open on hinges to allow access the circuit boards, and for easy access to all of the other 
system components.




In 1978, IBM 5100 was superseded by the IBM 5110 line of computers.













Most of the circuit boards have unusual IBM proprietary silver-colored metal integrated circuit (IC) chips.








There isn't a discrete CPU (Central Processing Unit) as in modern computers, the circuit board 
seen below is the "processor" - it has over 15 large chips.









	


Caption: "HAYSTACK IN THE NEEDLE - This computer chip contains 48,000 separate 
bits of information, yet it fits inside the eye of a common sewing needle.



Such chips made possible IBM's new, 50-pound portable computer which can be carried to the business problems 
it was designed to solve."
