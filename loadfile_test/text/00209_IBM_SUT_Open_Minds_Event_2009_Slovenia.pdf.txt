Why integrate telephony as part of UC ?
� Voice has been primary method of business 

communications for decades and is an integral 
component of UC

� Increases productivity
– Voice extends the value of your UC platform
– Improve collaboration by starting with presence: 

see availability and best way to reach someone.  
Start with presence and IM, escalate to voice 
and video when needed 

� Saves money 
– Use IP network. Reduce calling card costs and 

need for hard-phones for some mobile workers
– Reduce cost of external audio conferencing for 

with easy to use click-to-conference for ad hoc 
conferences

� Facilitates office mobility

UC with voice integration helps ROI

� Improve productivity
� Improve collaboration, drive innovation
� Improve business processes - faster decision 

making, time to market and responsiveness

� Cost savings
