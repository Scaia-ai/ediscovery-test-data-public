CHAPTER

1 Product Overview

Features and Benefits

The IBM 1x8 Console Switch and the IBM 2x16 Console Switch integrate keyboard, video, and 
mouse (KVM) switching technology with advanced cable management, flexible access for up to 
two simultaneous users, and an intuitive user interface. The console switches feature powerful on-
screen management for easy system configuration and server selection.

NOTE: The 1x8 console switch enables a single local user to access any attached servers. The 2x16 console 
switch enables two simultaneous users to access attached servers.

The IBM 3M Console Switch Cables (PS/2 and USB) are unique benefits of the console switch. By 
using CAT 5 cabling, the switch cable reduces cable clutter, while providing optimal resolution and 
video settings. The built-in memory of the switch cable simplifies configuration by assigning and 
retaining unique server names and port numbers for each attached server. The switch cable is 
powered directly from the server and provides Keep Alive functionality even if the console switch 
is not turned on. Keep Alive functionality enables the server to operate properly with or without 
connectivity to the console switch.

Switch Cable

The switch cable enables direct KVM connectivity to servers attached to the console switch. The 
1x8 console switch has 8 Analog Rack Interface (ARI) ports and the 2x16 console switch has 16 
ARI ports for connecting switch cables.

2        IBM Console Switch Installation and User’s Guide
The  USB switch cable is used to connect a USB server to a console switch. This cable has one HD15 
connector for video and one USB connector for keyboard and mouse.

Figure 1.1:  PS/2 Switch Cable and USB Switch Cable

OSCAR Graphical User Interface

The console switch uses the OSCAR interface, which features intuitive menus to configure the 
switch system and select servers. Servers can be identified by a unique name and port number, 
enabling you to assign a unique server name.

Security

The OSCAR interface enables you to protect the system with a screen saver password. After a user-
defined time, the screen saver mode engages, and access is prohibited until the appropriate 
password is entered to reactivate the system.

Video

The console switch provides optimal resolutions for analog VGA, SVGA, and XGA video. You 
can achieve resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 with a 3-m (9.8-ft) cable.

Plug and Play

The console switch also supports Display Data Channel (DDC) Plug and Play, which automates 
configuration of the monitor and is compliant with the VESA DDC2B standard. 

Firmware Upgrades

You can upgrade the firmware at any time through an update utility to be sure that the console 
switch system is always running the most current version available. See “Appendix A: Firmware 
Upgrades” for more information.

Tiering Expansion

The 1x8 console switch supports up to 8 directly attached servers and the 2x16 console switch 
supports up to16 directly attached servers. Each model can conveniently scale to support additional 
servers. You can expand the system by tiering with console switches and earlier-model console 
switches. This extra tier of units enables you to attach up to 256 servers in one system. See “Tiering 
Console Switches” in Chapter 2 for more information.

 Chapter 1: Product Overview        7
• Be sure that the monitor and attached devices are electrically rated to operate with the power 
available in your location. 

• Use only power cables provided with the console switch. 
• To help prevent electric shock, plug the console switch and peripheral power cables into prop-

erly grounded electrical outlets. These cables are equipped with three-prong plugs to help 
ensure proper grounding. Do not use adapter plugs or remove the grounding prong from 
a cable.

• Observe extension cable and power strip ratings. Make sure that the total ampere rating of all 
products plugged into the power strip does not exceed 80 percent of the ampere ratings limit 
for the power strip.

• To help protect the console switch from sudden, transient increases and decreases in electrical 
power, use a surge suppressor, line conditioner, or uninterruptible power supply.

• Position console switch cables and power cables carefully. Route cables so that they cannot be 
stepped on or tripped over. Be sure that nothing rests on any cables.

• Do not modify power cables or plugs. Consult a licensed electrician or the power company for 
site modifications. Always follow the local and national wiring rules.

Rack Mounting of Systems

• Refer to the rack installation documentation accompanying the rack for specific caution 
statements and procedures.

• Elevated ambient temperature: If installed in a closed rack assembly, the operation temperature 
of the rack environment can be greater than room ambient. Use care not to exceed the rated 
maximum ambient temperature of the unit.

• Reduced air flow: Carefully install the equipment in a rack so that an adequate amount of 
airflow is maintained for safe operation of the equipment.

• Mechanical loading: Avoid a potentially hazardous condition caused by uneven mechanical loading 
by carefully mounting the equipment in the rack.  

• Circuit overloading: Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the 
supply circuit and the effect that overloading of circuits might have on overcurrent protection 
and supply wiring. Consider equipment nameplate ratings for maximum current.

• Reliable earthing: Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained. Pay 
particular attention to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit 
(for example, use of power strips).

3. Repeat these steps for the local port set labeled B (2x16 only).
4. Bundle and label the cables for easy identification.

Tiering Multiple Console Switches

You can tier multiple console switches to enable one or two users to connect to up to 256 servers. 
In a tiered system, each ARI port on the main console switch will connect to the Analog Console 
Interface (ACI) port on each tiered console switch. Each tiered switch can then be connected to up 
to 8 servers on the 1x8 console switch and up to 16 servers on the 2x16 console switch. The 
example in Figure 2.4 shows one console switch tiered under the main switch, enabling the 
connection of up to 15 primary servers and 16 secondary servers. In this configuration, you could 
tier 16 console switches under the main switch, enabling the connection of up to 256 servers. Only 
one level of tiering is supported in this type of configuration, which means that you cannot tier 
additional earlier-model switches or another console switch. In this configuration, the tiered local 
port On-screen Configuration and Activity Reporting (OSCAR) interface is disabled when the 
main console switch is tiered below another console switch.

NOTE: As shown in Figure 2.4, only the local user A has an ACI port that can be used for the tiered connection.

1. Connect the tiered console switch to each server as described in the previous “Installing the 
Console Switch” section.

2. Connect the peripheral devices to local user A of the main switch as described in “Connecting 
local peripheral devices.”

3. Attach one end of the CAT 5 cable that will connect the main and tiered console switch to the 
RJ-45 (ACI) connector of local user A on the tiered console switch. 

4. Attach the other end of the CAT 5 cable to one of the 16 RJ-45 (ARI) ports on the main 
console switch.

NOTE: The system will automatically tier the two switches together as one. All servers connected to the tiered 
console switch will display on the main console switch server list in the OSCAR interface.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all additional (secondary) tiered console switches you want 
to attach.

Adding Earlier-model Switches

You can add earlier-model switches for easy integration into the existing configuration. In a tiered 
system, each ARI port will accommodate up to 16 servers. When earlier-model switches are tiered 
under the 1x8 console switch or the 2x16 console switch, the console switch must be at the top 
level of the tier. See the following table for earlier-model switches compatible with the console 
switch configuration.

CHAPTER

3 Basic Operations

Controlling the System at the Local Ports

The console switch features two local port sets on the back of the unit that enable you to connect a 
monitor and a PS/2 keyboard and mouse for direct local access. The 1x8 console switch enables 
you to connect a single local user, whereas the 2x16 console switch enables you to connect two 
users. The console switch uses the OSCAR interface, which uses intuitive menus to configure the 
system and select servers.

Viewing and Selecting Ports and Servers

Use the OSCAR Main window to view, configure, and control servers directly connected to the 
console switch. View the servers by name or port. You will see an OSCAR interface-generated port 
list by default when you first launch the OSCAR interface. 
The Port column indicates the ARI port to which a server is connected. If you connect an earlier-
model switch to the console switch or a tiered console switch, the port numbering displays the ARI 
port first, then the switch port to which the server is connected. For example, in Figure 3.1, servers 
06-01, 06-03, 06-02, 06-04, and 01-02 are connected to tiered switches. 

Accessing the Main window

1. Press Print Screen to launch the OSCAR interface. The Main window opens.

NOTE: You can use the Reset button to reset the PS/2 switch cable. This activity is only relevant when the 
console switch system involves a PS/2 switch cable attached to a tiered switch. On these occasions, you might 
need to reset the PS/2 switch cable when the tiered switch is not recognized. If a reset is performed when a 
console switch is connected directly to a server and not a tiered switch, the mouse/keyboard might fail to 
respond. When this occurs, the target server requires a restart.

 Chapter 3: Basic Operations        35
Figure 3.16:  Broadcast Window

NOTE: Broadcasting Keystrokes - The keyboard state must be identical for all servers receiving a broadcast to 
interpret keystrokes identically. Specifically, the Caps Lock and Num Lock modes must be the same on all 
keyboards. While the console switch attempts to send keystrokes to the selected servers simultaneously, some 
servers can block and thereby delay the transmission.

NOTE: Broadcasting Mouse Movements - For the mouse to work accurately, all systems must have identical 
mouse drivers, desktops (such as identically placed icons) and video resolutions. In addition, the mouse must be 
in exactly the same place on all screens. Because these conditions are extremely difficult to achieve, 
broadcasting mouse movements to multiple systems can have unpredictable results.

Broadcasting to selected servers

1. From the Broadcast window, select one or both keyboard and mouse check boxes for the 
servers that are to receive the broadcast commands.
-or-
Press the Up or Down Arrow keys to move the cursor to the target server. Then press Alt+K to 
select the keyboard check box and Alt+M to select the mouse check box. Repeat for additional 
servers.

Appendices
Appendix A: Firmware Upgrades

Upgrading the console switch
You can upgrade the firmware of the console switch by using a special update utility. This utility 
automatically configures the port communications settings to enable direct downloading from the 
connected server.

Items needed for the upgrade
The following items are required to upgrade the console switch firmware:

• Server running Microsoft® Windows® NT®, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, 
Windows 2003

• Available serial port (COM port) on the server
• Standard serial cable that connects the switch and the server 
• Firmware update

Upgrading firmware

1. Connect a standard serial cable to a COM port on the server and to the serial connector on the 
back panel of the switch. Make a note of which COM port you have chosen, then turn on 
the switch. 

2. Go to http://www.ibm.com/pc/support and click on Downloads and drivers. Search on the 
product name to access the firmware upgrade file. After the download is complete, navigate to 
the drive where you have saved the firmware update and unzip the file. 

3. Double-click to run the file WUpDate.exe. 
4. In the window that opens, select the language and COM port. 
5. Click Load. 
6. After the firmware is updated, the following message displays Download complete. Click 

Done to exit the window. 
7. The switch automatically restarts after the upgrade is completed. 

Possible error conditions
If the download does not execute properly, verify the following:
• The COM port is correct. 
• No other program is currently using the COM port, or that a previous DOS window or shell is 

open that had used the COM port. 

APPENDICES
onfidential IBM Confidential IBM Confidential IBM Confidential 

• No other copies of the WUpDate utility are currently running.
