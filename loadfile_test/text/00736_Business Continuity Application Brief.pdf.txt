Business Continuity 
 

 

CHAIN for Corporate Critical Infrastructure 
 

 

GOAL 
To empower companies to stay connected with the right people in real-time, to ensure seamless 
communications continuity for emergency and day-to-day business needs.   
 

 

CHALLENGE 
Events of all sizes can disrupt productivity, operations and profits for any company.  Terrorist 
events, network failures, power outages, security breaches and inclement weather all have the 
ability to interrupt critical day-to-day business activities.  Take for instance the recent surge of 
hurricanes throughout the United States.  Events such as Hurricanes Katrina and Ivan greatly 
affect supply chains, sales, production, price, and employment for thousands of businesses. 
With instances such as these imminent, it is becoming essential for businesses to implement a 
reliable and comprehensive emergency notification system in order to keep managers, 
employees and key stakeholders informed.    
 

Current corporate contingency plans do a good job of addressing business responses to a 
multitude of disruptions; however businesses lack the appropriate tools to effectively put these 
plans into action when the time comes. In order to successfully emerge from a crisis companies 
need a way to respond quickly, accurately and efficiently in order to sustain long-term stability 
and business continuity.   
 

 

SOLUTION 
Invizeon provides an unparalleled solution for businesses facing this challenge:  CHAIN.  
CHAIN is a robust system that allows companies to extend current contingency plans and 
communication capabilities to ensure prepared, rapid and organized responses to emergencies 
as well as day-to-day events.  The system can quickly alert predefined groups simultaneously 
with a consistent message on various devices including email, cell phone, work phone, pager, 
fax and PDA.   After the alert is sent, companies gain valuable insight into the status of a 
situation through the reporting features by knowing who has received and acknowledged the 
alert.  In addition, responders have a better chance of receiving the message because of 
predefined profiles and notification preferences.  The CHAIN solution is a dynamic, 
collaborative, configurable system that allows businesses to effectively communicate the right 
message, to the right people, in real-time.  CHAIN empowers businesses by offering the 
following capabilities:
