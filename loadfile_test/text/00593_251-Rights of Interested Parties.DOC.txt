SEC. 17.	WHAT RIGHTS TO NOTICE AND COMMENT DO INTERESTED PARTIES HAVE?

(FROM REVENUE PROCEDURE 2002-6)

Rights of interested parties

.01	Persons who qualify as interested parties under section 1.7476-1(b), have the following rights:

To receive notice, in accordance with section 18 below, that an application for an advance determination will be filed regarding the qualification of plans described in sections 401, 403(a), 409 and/or 4975(e)(7) of the Code;

To submit written comments with respect to the qualification of such plans to the Service;

To request the Department of Labor to submit a comment to the Service on behalf of the interested parties; and

To submit written comments to the Service on matters with respect to which the Department of Labor was requested to comment but declined.

Comments by interested parties

.02	Comments submitted by interested parties must be received by EP Determinations by the 45th day after the day on which the application for determination is received by EP Determinations.  (However, see sections 17.03 and 17.04 for filing deadlines where the Department of Labor has been requested to comment).  Such comments must be in writing, signed by the interested parties or by an authorized representative of such parties (as provided in section 9.02(11) of Rev. Proc. 2002-4).  Addressed to EP Determinations at the address in section 6.18 and contain the following information:

The names of the interested parties making the comments;

The name and taxpayer identification number of the applicant for a determination;

The name of the plan, the plan identification number, and the name of the plan administrator;

Whether the parties submitting the comment are:

Employees eligible to participate under the plan,

Employees with accrued benefits under the plan, or former employees with vested benefits under the plan,

Beneficiaries of deceased former employees who are eligible to receive or are currently receiving benefits under the plan,

Employees not eligible to participate under the plan.

The specific matters raised by the interested parties on the question of whether the plan meets the requirements for qualification involving sections 401 and 403(a) of the Code, and how such matters relate to the interests of the parties making the comment; and

The address of the interested party submitting the comment (or if a comment is submitted jointly by more than one party, the name and address of a designated representative) to which all correspondence, including a notice of the Service's final determination with respect to qualification, should be sent.  (The address designated for notice by the Service will also be used by the Department of Labor in communicating with the parties submitting a request for comment.)  The designated representative may be one of the interested parties submitting the comment or an authorized representative.  If two or more interested parties submit a single comment and one person is not designated in the comment as the representative for receipt of correspondence, a notice of determination mailed to any interested party who submitted the comment shall be notice to all the interested parties who submitted the comment for purposes of section 7476(b)(5) of the Code.

Requests for DOL to submit comments

.03	A request to the Department of Labor to submit to EP Determinations a comment pursuant to section 3001(b)(2) of ERISA must be made in accordance with the following procedures.

The request must be received by the Department of Labor by the 25th day after the day the application for determination is received by EP Determinations.  However, if the parties requesting the Department to submit a comment wish to preserve the right to comment to EP Determinations in the event the Department declines to comment, the request must be received by the Department by the 15th day after the day the application for determination is received by EP Determinations.

The request to the Department of Labor to submit a comment to EP Determinations must:

Be in writing;

Right to comment if DOL declines to comment

.04 	If a request described in 17.03 is made and the Department of Labor notifies the interested parties making the request that it declines to comment on a matter concerning qualification of the plan which was raised in the request, the parties submitting the request may still submit a comment to EP Determinations on such matter.  The comment must be received by the later of the 45th day after the day the application for determination is received by EP Determinations or the 15th day after the day on which notification is given by the Department that it declines to submit a comment on such matter.  (See section 17.07 for the date of notification.)  In no event may the comment be received later than the 60th day after the day the application for determination was received.  Such a comment must comply with the requirements of section 17.02 and include a statement that the comment is being submitted on matters raised in a request to the Department upon which the Department declined to comment.

Confidentiality of comments

.05 	For rules regarding the confidentiality of contents of written comments submitted by interested parties to the Service pursuant to section 17.02 or 17.04, see section 601.201(o)(5) of the Statement of Procedural Rules.

Availability of comments

.06 	For rules regarding the availability to the applicant of copies of all comments on the application submitted pursuant to section 17.01(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this revenue procedure, see section 601.201(o)(5) of the Statement of Procedural Rules.

When comments are deemed made

.07 	An application for an advance determination, a comment to EP Determinations, or a request to the Department of Labor shall be deemed made when it is received by EP Determinations, or the Department.  Notification by the Department that it declines to comment shall be deemed given when it is received by the interested party or designated representative.  The notice described in section 18.01 below shall be deemed given when it is given in person, posted as prescribed in the regulations under section 7476, or received through the mail or a private delivery service that has been designated under section 7502(f).  In the case of an application, comment, request, notification, or notice that is sent by mail or designated private delivery service, the date of which it shall be deemed received will be determined under section 7502.  However, if such an application, comment, request, notification, or notice is not received within a reasonable period from the date determined under section 7502, the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply.
