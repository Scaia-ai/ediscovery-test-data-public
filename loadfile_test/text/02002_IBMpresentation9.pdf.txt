IBM Proprietary12

Properly managing customer information across lines of business is a critical enabler 
to any customer-centered strategy and can have significant impact on a company’s
bottom line.

Defining Multi-Channel



IBM Proprietary13

Costs of “Dysfunctional” Channels
n Inefficiencies driving higher costs

u Duplication of processes
u Extra effort required to “co-ordinate” multi-channel initiatives

n Lost Sales Opportunities
u “Targeted” customers not identified when they touch the bank
u Customer needs and wants not universally understood
u Longer lead to time to introduce new products and initiatives

n Lower Customer Satisfaction
u Inconsistent treatment across channels
u Discontinuous conversations across channels
u “The financial institution does not know me”
u Inconsistent offers to customers

Defining Multi-Channel



IBM Proprietary14

Multi-channel Integration – What are the key elements?

n There are multiple solution components that drive a multi-channel 
environment. Despite the variety in solution components all solutions must 
enable the following:

u A single operational single view of the customer 
= single data source

u Realtime access to relevant customer information at the point of contact 
= compute power + connection speed

u Ability of enterprise to react appropriately to customers at all points of contact   
= new generation of integrated application software

Building a Multi-Channel Infrastructure



So…. why is that multi-channel thing so hard?

Building a Multi-Channel Infrastructure



IBM Proprietary16

Ideally, a Customer-Centric (aka Customer Relationship-based) Business Architecture 
can be described as a comprehensive end to end solution enabled by tightly integrated 
processes and infrastructure.
