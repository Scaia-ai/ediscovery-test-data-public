2 Importing the Stored Procedure 

 

 

A stored procedure which returns a cursor will need to have the output 
parameters remapped within Composite studio.  This example uses a variation of 
the MSSQL Northwind sample stored procedure CustOrdersOrders. 
 
CREATE PROCEDURE ACustOrdersOrders @MinId int, @MaxId int 
AS 
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID 
FROM Orders where OrderId  > @MinId and OrderId < @MaxId 
GO 
 
The variation takes in two int parameters and returns a cursor with the three 
columns.  OrderID int, CustomerID nchar(5) and EmployeeID int. 
 
This document makes the assumption that MSSQL JDBC connectivity has already 
been established.   
 
 
Right click on the Northwind data source under Shared\ sources and select Add 
Remove/ Resources …

Select the ACustOrdersOrders stored procedure and click Finish. 
 

 

 

The stored procedure should now be visible under Shared/sources within the 
Composite Studio.

Right click on the ACustOrdersOrders stored procedure and select Open.  Then in 
the top right of the screen check the Design Mode checkbox. 

 

 

 
Click OK to the Introspection Override Notes message box. 
 
Select all the input and output parameters via a shift click and delete. 

 

 

 

We know that this stored procedure takes in two integer input parameters.  We 
also know that the return cursor will return two integer fields and one nchar(5) 
fields.  All 5 objects will need to be created manually.

Click on the Add button and select Integer\Integer. 
 

 

 

Change the name of the parameter to MinId.  Then make it an in parameter by 
clicking on the cycle I/O direction button on the toolbar. 

 

 

 

Repeat the above step for the second input parameter MaxId.  To map the 
output cursor, click on Add and select Complex Cursor.

Change the cursor to an out parameter using the cycle I/O direction button on 
the toolbar. 

 

 

 

Now add the column names and the data types expected to be returned by the 
stored procedure.  OrderID int, CustomerID nchar(5) and EmployeeId int.  Notice 
that the size of the varchar can be specified by right clicking on the parameter 
and selecting Change Type…

The stored procedure is now ready to be tested.  Click on the exclamation mark 
on the toolbar and enter the prompt values.  For this example the Literals of 
10248 and 10271 were used for MinId and MaxId.   

 

 

 

Click OK to execute the Stored Procedure.

If the stored procedure returns a result in the bottom right window, it is ready to be 
published to the Composite Data Services. 
 

3 Publishing to the Composite Data Services 

 

Publish the object by right mouse clicking on the ACustOrdersOrders object and 
selecting Publish. 

 

Select or Create the appropriate Composite Data Service Database, Catalog and  
Schema and click OK. 

 

 

The Stored Procedure can now be utilized within Framework Manager via the 
Composite ODBC driver.
