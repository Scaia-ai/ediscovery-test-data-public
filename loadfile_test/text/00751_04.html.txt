Hi,

AIX 5L (Monterey Project) was to allow AIX to run on serveral different platforms.* Unfortunately they never finished it.* I heard that version 5.0 (the first release) was the working version on the intel platform.*  of the problems was that it took way to long to complete Monterey.* Linux took off as a valid S.* It looks like IBM cut their losses and droped the support for AIX on Intel.
