�This number should be the Texas State Comptroller of Public Accounts 11-digit taxpayer number; these numbers do not include SSNs. Please check the �HYPERLINK "http://ecpa.cpa.state.tx.us/vendor/tpsearch1.html" ��Comptroller’s website� to determine if the contractor has a Comptroller 11-digit VID; if they do not leave this line blank.  For a contractor to be paid they must also be set up as a UT payee; please find guidance on this process at �HYPERLINK http://www.utexas.edu/admin/purchasing/vid.html ��http://www.utexas.edu/admin/purchasing/vid.html�.  OSS-Accounting & Purchasing Services (499-4129) can assist with questions.



� Consulting services are the services of studying or advising a state agency under a contract that does not involve the traditional relationship of employer and employee.  Please contact Accounting and Purchasing Services if you need assistance in determining whether the services you are acquiring are consulting services.

� 	Contract workers are defined as “independent contractors, temporary workers supplied by staffing companies, contract company workers and consultants.”  If your contract primarily involves the provision of labor (as opposed to the provision of goods), it is likely a contract for contract workforce.  Please check with Accounting and Purchasing Services if you are unsure.
