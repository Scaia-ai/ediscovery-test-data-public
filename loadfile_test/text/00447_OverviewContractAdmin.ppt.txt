Effective Contract Management Planning
For Performance-Based Contracting


It’s a Different Contracting World!

Performance-Based Acquisition fundamentally changed contract formation and administration

Objectives structured into contracts and multiple incentive arrangements

Contractors and Federal staff adjusting to a cultural change




When does Contract Management start?
Old View
Started at contract award
Embodied a post-award orientation
New View 
Effective contract administration starts early with contract management planning
Begins during the acquisition planning phase
Recognizes the performance-based elements of the contract
The Contract Management Plan is in place before or shortly after the time of award


The Performance-Based Contract 
What are the elements of  Performance-Based Contracting?
FAR 37.6, 16.402 and DEAR 917.601 require:
Establish requirements in a results oriented manner
Ensure that Contract measures and expectations are measurable and correspond to work requirements
Ensure that Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans are tailored to contract objectives 
Incorporate cost constraints or cost incentives

Acquisition Guide, Chapter 70.8
Performance Based Contracting Guide – provides guidance on structuring effective incentives



The Performance-Based Contract
What are the elements of Performance-Based Contracting? (cont.)
In 1997 OFPP mandated that PBCs
Requirements are structured in a results or outcome oriented manner
Positive and/or negative incentives are included
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans are required





What are the Contracting Officers Responsibilities in Performance-Based Contracting? 

FAR 37.106 and 37.602-4
Ensure that performance-based contracting used to the maximum extent practicable. 
Use contract types that best fits the work and likely to motivate contractors.
Use positive or negative performance incentives to the maximum extent practicable.
Quality assurance surveillance plan shall contain measurable inspection and acceptance criteria corresponding to the performance standards of the SOW.

Contractor Motivation (fee, more work, Peer recognition, past performance assessments)

Incentivize Results! Review lessons learned!



Performance-Based Contracting at DOE
Major Site and Facilities Contracts
General Work scope (M&O)
Spallation Neutron source
National Ignition Facility
Major projects
Site Clean-up (Rocky Flats, Mound, Fernald)
Services
Guard services, information technology and janitorial
Contract Type & Incentive Structure
Select contract type and incentive structure that best fits the requirements



Contract Management at DOE
Contract Management
DOE’s major site and facility contracts are usually long-term and involve a complex mix of sponsors and stakeholders
Integrated Team Members (CO, COR, Technical Monitor, Federal Project Director, HCA, Headquarter, CFO, contractor, etc.)

DOE Contract Management Focus Areas
Project Management, change control, baseline management, technology, performance, quality assurance, fee and incentive management, contractor human resources, etc.



Key Contract Management
Responsibilities and Focus Areas
CO Contract Management Responsibilities
Ensuring performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting (FAR Part 42), 

Ensuring compliance with the terms of the contract,

Safeguarding the interests of the contractual relationships,

Requesting and considering advice of specialists in audit, law, engineering, and other fields, as appropriate, 

Monitoring Performance, and
 
Enforcing the Government’s rights when necessary.



The Contract Management Team

Success Depends on an Integrated Team!
Contracting Officer, COR, Project Director, etc. 
Effective administration of PBCs relies heavily on the integration efforts of groups of people representing many functional areas, customers, and stakeholders
Past problems can be traced to lack of an integrated effort in managing contract performance

Manage the contract not the people or the process




Key Tools of Contract Management

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

Contract Management Planning

Earned Value Management



Ensuring the Quality of Performance
QASP
Develop early - during the early stages of the RFP (SOW)
Tool to evaluate contractor’s performance
Provides a structured approach to performing quality inspections and surveillance
Establishes frequency and types of inspections
Focuses on results - quality and timeliness

QASP linked with Performance Evaluation Management Plans (PEMPs)
PEMPs establish the performance evaluation process and  fee determination process
PEMPs may be used to fulfill QASP requirement



Contract Management Planning

Why Plan for Contract Management?
Challenges by GAO, IG and internal DOE reviews
More sophisticated contracting models
Performance-based contracting
More rigorous contract types, i.e. CPIF
DOE Contract Administration Study
Little interface between all parties managing the contract
Infrastructure/culture not keeping pace with PBCs 
Lack of “game plan” for managing contracts 
To develop a “corporate oversight strategy” for ensuring contract success




Contract Management Planning 
(AL2003-02)
When is a Contract Management Plan (CMP) Required?
For all M&O & Major Site and Facility Contracts
Contracts subject to DOE O 413.3
Desirable for service contracts that are complex., high risk with a high $$ value

How do we develop an effective corporate oversight strategy/CMP?
Begin planning during the earliest stages of the RFP preparation
Review the contract and identify key governmental responsibilities (GFI, equipment, receiverships, etc.)


Contract Management Planning
How do we develop an effective corporate oversight strategy/CMP? (cont.)
Get input from the contractor to ensure critical areas are identified
Identify key contract vulnerabilities or performance risk areas that are inherent in the contract
Develop a strategy for managing unique terms and conditions (award term, incentives, etc.)
Develop a proactive approach for managing the governmental responsibilities and for mitigating any identified risk areas
Formally identify the key contract management team, include their names, responsibilities, authorities and limitations




Contract Management Planning
How do we develop an effective corporate oversight strategy/CMP? (cont.)
Develop training and guidance to help the culture (infrastructure/people) evolve if site is managing a new contract type (CPIF), 
Develop an approach for managing the incentive fee arrangements of the contract, and
Ensure that other critical focus areas are included - management of contractor litigation, partnering agreements, records management, and other site specific challenges.



Contract Management Planning
How can we use the CMP to ensure successful contract performance?
Coordinate and solicit input from all staff involved in contract management
Conduct a special session with the contractor on the goals and objectives of the CMP and name the individuals (CO, COR, TM, etc.) responsible for its implementation
Meet with all concerned parties on a regular basis to address issues
Track performance and assess progress against the QASP
Address performance risks or deficiencies early
Update the CMP as necessary



Assessing Contractor Performance
Earned Value Management
Contractor use EVM to control cost and schedule performance as well as report progress against the contract
DOE uses EVM to:
Monitor and verify progress on contract costs and schedule performance
Monitor and validate contractor accomplishments on specific fee and PBI incentives
Early warning system to identify deficient progress


Contract Management Planning
What is the Contracting Officer’s role in EVM?
The CO is responsible for ensuring that EVM is a requirement in the RFP (when applicable)
After award, the CO is responsible for receiving the contract performance reports, approving changes to the system, and generally ensuring that the system requirements are being met
The CO relies on subject matter experts for advice on the integrity of the system
The CO is responsible for enforcing the terms of the contract and requesting corrective action as necessary
