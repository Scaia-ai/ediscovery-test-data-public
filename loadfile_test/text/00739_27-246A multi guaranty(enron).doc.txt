WHEREAS, Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Transactions to be entered into between the Enron Parties and the Duke Parties.


NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the Duke Parties entering into the Contracts, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:


1.  GUARANTY.  Subject to the provisions hereof, (a) Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the timely payment when due of the obligations of the Enron Parties (the “Obligations”) to the Duke Parties under the Contracts, and (b) to the extent that any of the Enron Parties shall fail to pay any Obligations to the Duke Parties, Guarantor shall promptly pay to the Duke Parties the amount due.  This Guaranty shall constitute a continuing guarantee and a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be subject to the following:

(a)  Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under the Contracts (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and, except to the extent specifically provided in the Contracts, in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, tort, or any other damages.

(b)  The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty, including costs, fees and expenses, shall not exceed $30,000,000 (the “Guarantee Cap”).


The Guarantee Cap shall not be affected by the holding or application of any collateral or other credit support by Counterparty.


2.  DEMANDS AND NOTICE.  If any Enron Party (the “Defaulting Enron Party”) fails or refuses to pay any Obligations, and a Duke Party has elected to exercise its rights under this Guaranty, such Duke Party shall make a demand upon Guarantor (hereinafter referred to as a “Payment Demand”).  A Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount the Defaulting Enron Party has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific statement that such Duke Party is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guaranty.  A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must pay the Obligations within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the Payment Demand.  A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default, until the Defaulting Enron Party or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured.  As used herein, the term “Business Day” shall mean a day on which commercial banks or financial institutions are open for business in Houston, Texas and New York, New York.


	Guarantor shall not be liable for any Payment Demands in excess of the Guarantee Cap.  In the event Guarantor receives approximately simultaneous Payment Demands from the Duke Parties with respect to Obligations owed under more than one Contract in excess of the Guarantee Cap, Guarantor’s total payment up to but not exceeding $30,000,000 shall be allocated among the Contracts in accordance with each Contract’s percentage of the total amount demanded by both.  In all other instances, Guarantor’s payments hereunder, up to and including, but not in excess of the Guarantee Cap, will be made in the order in which the associated Payment Demands were received.


3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:

(a)  it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the Guaranty; 

(b)  to its knowledge no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty; and

(c)  this Guaranty, when executed and delivered, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor, except as the enforceability of this Guaranty may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity.


4.  SETOFFS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.  Without limiting Guarantor’s own defenses and rights hereunder, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses to which any Defaulting Enron Entity is or may be entitled to arising from or out of the Contracts except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of any Defaulting Enron Entity.


5.  AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and the Duke Parties.


6.  WAIVERS.  Except as required in Section 2 above, Guarantor hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Guarantor; and (c) any right to require that any action or proceeding be brought against the Enron Parties or any other person, or to require that the Duke Parties seek enforcement of any performance against any Enron Entity or any other person, prior to any action against Guarantor under the terms hereof.  Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of the Duke Parties in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.  Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Contracts.


Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to Counterparty and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination shall be effective until ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Duke Parties of such termination notice.  No such termination shall affect Guarantor’s liability with respect to any Transactions entered into prior to the time the termination is effective, which Transactions and the obligations of the Enron Parties with respect thereto under the Contracts, shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty.


7.  NOTICE.  Any Payment Demand, notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other document to be given hereunder by any party to another (herein collectively called “Notice”) shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by telegram or telecopier, as follows:
