Conditions: 


This renewal is made in accordance with the "Renewal Clause" contained in the original contract dated January 9, 1996 and any addenda issued thereafter.  Approval of this renewal has been expressed by the contractor and the Director of Purchases for the State of Kansas.


All terms, prices and conditions of the original contract as amended shall remain in effect.


Quarterly Reports:   The vendor is required to submit quarterly, to the Division of Purchases, all acquisitions made by the state from this contract.  This report should include as a minimum the agency name, quantity, description, and amount.


Contract Price:  Statewide contracts are awarded by the Division of Purchases to take advantage of volume discount pricing for goods and services that have a recurring demand from one or more agencies.   However, if a state agency locates a vendor that can provide the identical item at a lower price, a waiver to "buy off state contract" may be granted by the Division of Purchases.
