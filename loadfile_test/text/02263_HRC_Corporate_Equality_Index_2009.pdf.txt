LETTER
FROM THE HRC FOUNDATION PRESIDENT

I am thrilled to share the 2009 Corporate 
Equality Index with you.

It is hard to believe that this is just the seventh year 
of the report. Originally designed as a roadmap 
for creating fair workplaces for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender employees at a time when 
discrimination against LGBT employees persisted 
and businesses lacked concrete guidance on LGBT 
inclusion, the CEI has burgeoned into the premiere 
benchmarking tool for gauging workplace equality. 

Since that first report in 2002, the rates at which 
corporate America has expanded policies, practices 
and benefits to include LGBT employees have 
been faster than perhaps many thought possible. 
The progress has been vast in its reach and deep in 
its impact. LGBT employees and consumers can 
recognize the hallmarks of an inclusive employer — 
from fully inclusive non-discrimination polices and 
diversity programming to equal benefits. As more 
businesses participate in the annual survey, LGBT 
Americans and our allies can make more informed 
decisions about where to work and spend money. 
Senior partners and CEOs have taken note of these 
choices and the competition for LGBT talent and 
consumer dollars is at an all-time high.  

In step with the CEI’s trend line of upward growth, 

— 65 more than last year, totaling over 9.3 million 
full-time employees working for 100 percent rated 
businesses. Many businesses are also seeking out 
practices to further distinguish their workplaces 

beyond the minimum benchmarks. The Human 
Rights Campaign Foundation continues to seek out 
the expertise of private-sector diversity leaders, LGBT 
workplace advocates and employees to build on the 
success of the CEI to date.

A record-breaking number of businesses submitted 
surveys this year. While not all of those are 
among the top-tier percentage-wise, we commend 
these businesses for engaging with the Human 
Rights Campaign Foundation and committing to 
transparency in their progress. I look forward to 
ushering more businesses into our 100-percent tier 
and having the opportunity to work side-by-side with 
these businesses as they move toward equality. 

We hope that you find this report useful and that the 
information contained herein can better inform your 
daily actions, because advancing LGBT equality must 
rest with all of us. From choosing a particular business 
in which to invest or buy goods or services, to sparking 
conversation at your workplace about LGBT issues, we 
can work together to move our colleagues, employers 
and communities toward change. 

Thank you,

Joe Solmonese
President, Human Rights Campaign Foundation

260businesses achieved the top rating of 100 percent this year, compared with 195 businesses that received perfect ratings in the previous year. Collectively, these businesses employ 9,345,581 full-time U.S. workers. The total number of businesses at 100 percent represent an increase of one-third over the previous year’s total number of 195 businesses. When 
the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index was 
launched in 2002, only 13 companies received 100 percent.

This year marked the third time the Fortune 
1000 list of the largest publicly traded 
companies was invited to take part in the 
Corporate Equality Index survey. The Fortune 
500 list has been invited each year since 2002.

Of the 255 Fortune 500-ranked businesses 
that the CEI rated, 120 received 100 percent 
ratings. The average CEI rating of Fortune 
500 companies was 83. Of the 54 Fortune-
ranked businesses between 500 and 1000, 
17 received 100 percent ratings. The average 
rating of these companies was 72.

Ten of the top 20 Fortune-ranked companies 
received 100 percent ratings, including newly 
rated Cardinal Health. 

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 1 40 

Exxon Mobil Corp. 2 0

General Motors Corp. 3 100

* The HRC Foundation does not have sufficient information 
to provide a rating for this company.

A total of 584 businesses were rated this year, an 
increase of 13 percent over the 2008 CEI. The 
average rating across the entire index was 83, 
compared to 81 percent last year.

Other businesses showed tremendous progress from 
last year’s rating. Four businesses had improvements 
of at least 50 percentage points: American 
International Group Inc., Bayer Corp., Nestle 
Purina PetCare Co. and Omnicom Group.

Two companies continued to get a rating of zero, 
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Perot Systems Corp. 

Neither company has taken steps to improve its 
rating; ExxonMobil has resisted mounting shareholder 
pressure to amend its non-discrimination policies. 
In a sign of improvement, Meijer, a grocery chain 
that received a rating of zero in 2008, added sexual 
orientation to its non-discrimination policy and raised 
its score to 15 percent.

Two other companies opposed shareholder
resolutions to amend their non-discrimination policies
to include gender identity, Verizon Communications 
Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Their scores were 70 
and 40, respectively.

FINDINGS / PERFORMANCE BY

California and New York continue to accelerate ahead 
of other states, each adding at least seven new top-rated 
businesses to its list. However, 25 other states and the 
District of Columbia have at least one 100 percent rated 
business with its headquarters located there. Adding 
two businesses, Illinois continued to house many top-
rated businesses and Texas added eight top-percent 
rated businesses. The location of top-rated Corporate 
Equality Index employers resembles the number of Fortune 
500-ranked companies in each state.

INDUSTRY
FINDINGS / PERFORMANCE BY

Several industries saw improvement in both the average rating and the number of top-rated 
businesses: airlines; computer hardware and office equipment; food, beverages and groceries; 
insurance; law firms; and, retail and consumer products. 

Improvements made by Alaska Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. brought them to 100 percent 
alongside US Airways and seventh time top-rated business, American Airlines. Within computer 
hardware and office equipment, CDW Corp.’s expansion of equal benefits and workplace protections 
raised this industry’s overall ratings. The growth in the food, beverages and groceries industry is 
attributed to both newcomers to the 100 percent tier such as Diageo North America, as well 
as significant positive changes at businesses like Food Lion LLC — which added gender identity 
protections to its non-discrimination policy, and H.J. Heinz Co. — which implemented domestic 
partner benefits. Within the insurance industry, New York Life Insurance Co. and The Progressive 
Corp. both added gender identity protections, among other changes, further elevating the industry 
rating. In retail and consumer products, Barnes & Noble Inc. joined Borders Group Inc. at 100 
percent while Target Corp., Unilever and Kimberly-Clark Corp. reached the 100 percent tier this 
year as well. 

In 2006, the first year law firms were invited to participate, 12 achieved a score of 100 percent. That 
figure has leaped to an unprecedented industry high of 64 businesses occupying the 100 percent 
tier, eclipsing banking and financial services. Law firms are highly competitive in their recruitment 
efforts for law school graduates, and are also held to increasing standards of diversity by their 
corporate clients. LGBT equality is an integral part of these efforts to recruit and retain top talent 
and cultivate clients. Beyond the LGBT community, many allies look to CEI ratings as a bellwether 
for a potential employer’s commitment to diversity. 

Of the 35 industries represented on the HRC Foundation Corporate Equality Index, five have no top-
rated companies: engineering and construction; forest and paper products; mining and metals; 
residential real estate; and waste management.

w w w . h r c . o r g / c e iCORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX 20098

Since its inception in 2002, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index has 
provided businesses with a blueprint for establishing and maintaining inclusive workplaces for lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender employees. Beyond modeling success, the resources that supplement 
the CEI equip businesses with the tools they need to effect change throughout their organization. 

With an ever-increasing response rate, the extent to which businesses rely on the CEI has solidified 
its status as the benchmark by which businesses and their employees can gauge their success 
against competitors on LGBT inclusion. 

The HRC Foundation offers continually updated resources for employers on each of the criteria on 
its website at www.hrc.org/workplace.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE CRITERIA
The HRC Foundation is committed to maintaining rigorous, transparent and achievable criteria for 
the Corporate Equality Index and, just as importantly, providing the tools for employers to meet them. 
Changes to the criteria are made with input from expert LGBT workplace advocates and leaders at 
the most advanced firms, taking into consideration the changing landscape of legal protections for 
LGBT employees and their families from state to state.

In 2002, the first CEI rated employers on seven criteria that remain the basis for today’s rating 
system. The original criteria were guided in part by the Equality Principles —- 10 key practices for 
businesses committed to equal treatment of LGBT employees, consumers and investors. For more 
information, visit www.equalityproject.org/principles/en.html. 

Just 13 businesses achieved top ratings in that first year; by 2005, more than 100 businesses had 
achieved perfect ratings, with many establishing the next best practices such as spousal-equivalent 
partner benefits and transgender-inclusive benefits.

In 2006, the HRC Foundation rolled out the second and current version of the CEI criteria, with 
greater weight given to spousal-equivalent partner benefits and to transgender inclusion; these 
criteria remain in effect for the 2009 report. Future changes to the criteria will be announced at least 
12 months before going into effect.

THE ‘BEST PLACES TO WORK’ DISTINCTION
Businesses that are recognized in this report with a rating of 100 percent are further recognized as 
“Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality.” Such businesses are invited to use this distinction and the 
accompanying trademark in their recruitment and advertising efforts.

THE CURRENT CRITERIA
The following rating system has been in effect since the 2006 CEI report, and remains effective 
through this and the 2010 report. ▼

METHODOLOGY
HRC CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX RATING SYSTEM &

WHAT BUSINESSES ARE RATED
The Human Rights Campaign Foundation utilizes lists of the largest and most successful U.S. 
employers as a basis for inviting businesses to participate in the Corporate Equality Index, including 
Fortune magazine’s 1,000 largest publicly traded businesses (the 2007 Fortune 1000) and American 
Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (the 2007 AmLaw 200). Additionally, any 
private-sector, for-profit employer with 500 or more full-time U.S. employees can request to participate 
by e-mailing workplace@hrc.org.

HOW WE OBTAIN THE INFORMATION / THE HRC CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX SURVEY
The primary source of information for the CEI rating is the CEI survey (see Appendix D on page 65). 
While many questions on the survey are required for participation in the CEI, others are informational 
questions that help gauge trends and best practices among all businesses or particular industries.

Invitations for the 2009 CEI survey were mailed in March 2008. If a business had not previously 
participated in the CEI, surveys were sent to the chief executive officer or managing partner of the firm, 
as well as the highest level executive responsible for human resources or diversity when it was possible 
to obtain their information. If a business had previously participated in the CEI, surveys were first sent to 
the individuals responsible for previous submissions.

The web-based survey included links to sample policies and other guidance on the HRC Foundation 
Workplace Project website. HRC Foundation staff provided additional assistance and advice throughout 
the process and reviewed submitted documentation for appropriate language and consistency with 
survey answers. Businesses were able to check their preliminary ratings as they progressed through 
the online survey and were invited to provide HRC Foundation staff with any additional information or 
updates before this report went to print.

The HRC Foundation may occasionally rate businesses that have not submitted a survey this year if the 
business had submitted a survey in previous years and the information is determined to be accurate or 
if the HRC Foundation has obtained sufficient information to provide an individual rating. In both cases, 
the HRC Foundation notifies the business of the rating and asks for any updates or clarification.

A total of 1,567 businesses received invitations to take part in the survey. Of that number, 466 
submitted surveys and 584 were ultimately rated. Last year, a total of 1,806 businesses were sent 
invitations, 416 submitted surveys and 519 were rated. Fewer businesses received invitations this year 
to better focus on the primary target pool of businesses, namely the Fortune 1000 and AmLaw 200 as 
well as businesses that have pro-actively reached out to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 

The information required to generate CEI ratings for businesses is largely considered proprietary and 
is difficult to ascertain from public records alone. In addition to the self-reporting provided through the 
CEI survey, the HRC Foundation employs several methods to rate businesses. A team of researchers 
investigates and cross-checks the policies and practices of the rated businesses and the implications 
of those policies and practices for LGBT workers, including any connections with organizations that 
engage in anti-LGBT activities. Employers are not rated until all appropriate information has been 
gathered and verified to the extent possible.

49540x3_Final.indd   1049540x3_Final.indd   10 10/1/08   12:45:22 PM10/1/08   12:45:22 PM



w w w . h r c . o r g / c e i CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX 2009 11

In total, the sources used include:
 ■ The HRC Foundation Corporate Equality Index survey; 
 ■ Securities and Exchange Commission filings to track connections between public 
  companies’ significant shareholders and any organizations or activities that engage in 
  anti-LGBT activities (such connections are footnoted in this report, but do not necessarily 
  change a business’s rating); 
 ■ Internal Revenue Service 990 tax filings for business foundation gifts to anti-LGBT groups; 
 ■ Case law and news accounts for allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual 
  orientation and/or gender identity or expression that have been brought against any of 
  these businesses; 
 ■ Individuals or unofficial LGBT employee groups that report information to the HRC 
  Foundation; and 
 ■ The HRC Foundation Workplace Project, which since 1995 has collected information on 
  U.S. employers and today maintains the most accurate and extensive database of business 
  policies that affect LGBT workers and their families.

If a business was found to have a connection with an anti-LGBT organization or activity, the HRC 
Foundation contacted the business and gave them an opportunity to respond and ensure, to the best 
of its ability, that no such action would occur in the future. Businesses unwilling to do so lose 15 points 
from their overall rating through criterion 6, with a minimum possible total rating of zero points.

A NOTE ABOUT BUSINESSES’ RATINGS
Recognizing that many of the businesses rated in the CEI employ thousands of employees that 
span most, if not all, of the 50 states, each business’s rating should be viewed as a snapshot of its 
activity. A CEI rating cannot convey all the nuances of a business’s particular approach to LGBT 
workplace issues. Furthermore, some businesses’ ratings dropped from the previous year; the 
bulk of these businesses lost points because some data was no longer reliable and/or businesses

Non-Discrimination Policies and Diversity Training/Awareness

A clear and defined non-discrimination policy with respect to conditions of employment including hiring, 
promotions, termination and compensation that includes “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” or “gender 
identity or expression” —  in addition to federally protected classes such as age, race, sex, religion, national origin 
and disability — is an essential baseline policy for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender inclusion. 

To read more about Equal Opportunity Employment Issues for LGBT Workers, please visit www.hrc.org/
issues/about_equal_opportunity.asp.

Diversity awareness or employee training programs are important vehicles through which an employer 
communicates its expectations of fair treatment to employees. Rather than isolating diversity issues, an increasing 
number of employers are integrating lessons on diversity with other standard trainings that are skills or policy-
based. Each employer handles diversity training differently; some require all employees to attend, while others 
might only require managers or supervisors to attend.

SEXUAL ORIENTATION
Sexual orientation is generally defined as an individual’s enduring physical, romantic, emotional 
and/or spiritual attraction to another person.

of CEI-rated employers provide employment protections on the basis of gen-
der identity or expression, the highest figure to date. The expansion of these 
protections has been remarkable; growth from the 2002 CEI has been 12-fold 
when just 5 percent of CEI-rated employers included gender identity protec-
tions in 2002 (criterion 2a). 

GENDER IDENTITY
Gender identity is generally defined as an individual’s internal, personal sense of being a man or a 
woman. For transgender people, their birth-assigned sex and their own internal sense of gender iden-
tity do not match. Gender expression refers to all of the external characteristics and behaviors that are 
socially defined as either masculine or feminine, such as dress, grooming, mannerisms, speech patterns 
and social interactions. It is worth noting that social or cultural norms can vary widely and some char-
acteristics that may be accepted as masculine, feminine or neutral in one culture may not be assessed 
similarly in another. 

Gender identity and gender expression are distinct from sexual orientation — transgender people may be 
heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual.

Employers that revise their non-discrimination policies should examine internal policies and procedures 
with an eye toward how employees express their gender. This includes things such as personnel records 
and directories, restroom and changing facilities, as well as dress codes and harassment policies. Gender 
transition guidelines help ensure consistent treatment with regard to these matters when an employee 
transitions on the job. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation provides resources to address these 
issues on its website at www.hrc.org/workplace/transgender.

FINDINGS

TRANSGENDER-INCLUSIVE BENEFITS
Most transgender people are categorically denied health insurance coverage for necessary medical treat-
ment, often irrespective of whether treatment is related to sex reassignment. Up until the last few years, 
nearly all health insurance plans in the United States excluded coverage for sex reassignment or related 
treatment, and sometimes a plan’s exclusion is worded broadly to exclude many other necessary treat-
ments. While not all transgender people have the same medical needs, ending this discrimination against 
transgender people in benefits is a critical goal that the Human Rights Campaign Foundation is working 
with employers to achieve. For more information, please visit www.hrc.org/issues/9568.htm.

In 2001, the city and county of San Francisco made history by becoming the first U.S. municipalities to 
remove transgender access exclusions from their employee health plans. A 2006 statement from the 
San Francisco’s Human Rights Commission proclaimed, “Despite actuarial fears of over-utilization and 
a potentially expensive benefit, the Transgender Health Benefit Program has proven to be appropriately 
accessed and undeniably more affordable than other, often routinely covered, procedures.” Employees 
of the city and county of San Francisco, as well as their dependents, may now access necessary medi-
cal treatments without needing to pay additional premiums, as they did the first few years the program 
was available.

Since 2006, CEI survey participants have been asked to examine their insurance policies for transgender 
exclusions, and to ensure that at least one of the five general types of medically necessary treatment was 
available without exclusion. If treatment was generally available without exclusion (e.g.: if a plan covered 
medically necessary surgical procedures), the business was asked to provide supporting documentation.

The original intent of this criterion was not just to educate employers about these exclusions but also to 
encourage employers to remove them. Through our conversations and educational efforts with participat-
ing employers over the years, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has helped spotlight these dis-
criminatory insurance exclusions, and we have seen tremendous progress in removing them.

Some major insurers now provide limited options for employers to provide inclusive coverage. 
Nonetheless, based on feedback given to the HRC Foundation, employers that do not self-insure are at 
a disadvantage in being able to obtain comprehensive coverage. For self-insured plans, the employer 
assumes the risk of providing the benefits and paying all the claims and so it generally has greater con-
trol over what treatment is covered by the plan. These plans often involve a health insurance company or 
other third party to administer the plan. Smaller employers are much less likely to self-fund, and are thus 
limited to commercial health insurance options.

Health Insurance Benefits

On average, roughly 20 percent of employees’ overall compensation is provided in the form of health 
insurance benefits for themselves and often, for their families. For employees with partners and/or 
children not eligible for those benefits, this disparity in compensation is profound. Since the 1990s, 
domestic partner benefits have become the norm — the majority of Fortune 500 companies now 
provide them. More recently, employers have started to address health insurance discrimination against 
transgender individuals.

ENDING BENEFITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
TRANSGENDER EMPLOYEES

This year, in order to verify the information submitted for this criterion, the Human Rights Campaign 
Foundation asked survey participants to submit documentation to support that various medically 
necessary treatments would be covered by the insurance plan. Such documentation included:

 ■  a complete list of exclusions (typically found only in the plan contract itself) that 
  does not indicate a transgender exclusion;
 ■  clinical guidelines and/or contract language indicating that treatment would be 
  considered medically necessary (usually under circumstances resembling current 
  or previous versions of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health); or
 ■  other plan documents or employee communications indicating medically necessary 
  treatments would be covered.

While the Human Rights Campaign Foundation cannot attest that insurance coverage would ultimately 
be applied equally from business to business or even between multiple insurance plans used by the 
same business, our review suggests that a number of businesses have taken significant and substantial 
steps to remove discrimination from at least one of their health insurance plans for employees and their 
dependents.

49businesses had insurance plans that indicated that most medically neces-sary treatments would be covered. These businesses are highlighted in Appendices B & C with a “+” under column 2c.

CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX 2009w w w . h r c . o r g / c e i

Some of the first businesses to implement inclusive coverage placed a maximum financial amount 
of insurance coverage available to transgender-specific treatment over an individual’s lifetime. Of 
the 49 businesses that indicated most medically necessary treatments would be covered, only six 
reported a maximum financial cap, ranging from $10,000 to $75,000, with most reporting more than 
$50,000. Similar to the city and county of San Francisco, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation 
anticipates that businesses will eventually increase or eliminate these caps entirely.

The vast majority of employers that obtain credit for criterion 2c have done so through short-term 
leave coverage — which generally does not fall under health insurance and its exclusions — or men-
tal health counseling — which can also fall outside of the health insurance plan or, if covered by the 
health insurance plan, can fall outside the scope of more limited transgender exclusions.

Where the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has seen detailed documentation of coverage, 
it has generally been limited to specific procedures or treatments; such limitations could eventu-
ally be viewed as insufficient. Because there has not been a plan that clearly outlines coverage for 
the variety of possible treatments that could increase the likelihood of a successful transition and 
such plans are relatively new to insurers and employers, a top research goal of the Human Rights 
Campaign Foundation is to issue a more detailed report of the types of coverage generally available 
at these employers, as well as identified best and worst practices of such plans. 

Although not all transgender people have the same medical needs, standards of medical care for 
transgender people are maintained by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, 
which can be found online at www.wpath.org.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation provides resources relating to domestic partner benefits 
on its website at www.hrc.org/issues/domestic_partner_benefits.htm.

Beyond the extension of basic health insurance coverage, growth continues in the entire set of 
comprehensive health benefits made available to partners (criterion 3b), with 82 percent of rated 
employers providing equal dental, vision, dependent medical and Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act (COBRA)-like continuation coverage, up 19 percent from the previous year. COBRA-
like benefits continuation is the area that prevents many employers from obtaining credit on this criterion, 
which requires that all health benefits be offered equally to opposite-sex spouses and domestic partners 
of current employees; however, this gap is closing, as 83 percent of rated businesses now have parity in 
COBRA-like benefits. 

Where last year’s CEI saw significant growth in comprehensive health benefits but less so in the 
promotion of parity in “soft” benefits (criterion 3c), such as Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)-like 
leave benefits, bereavement leave, retirement benefits and employee discounts, this year the increase is 
18 percent for a total of 89 percent.

FINDINGS

92 of CEI-rated employers provide partner health coverage to employees (criterion 3a), up 16 percent from the previous year. Of these employers, 67 percent provide them to both same and opposite-sex partners of employees (just a one percentage point increase from last year).

PARTNER BENEFITS

Partner benefits are a low-cost, high-value employment benefit and are now the norm among employers 
committed to their LGBT employees. A 2005 Hewitt Associates study found that the majority of 
employers offering the benefits — 64 percent — experience a total financial impact of less than 1 percent 
of total benefits cost, 88 percent experience financial impacts of 2 percent or less and only 5 percent 
experience financial impacts of 3 percent or greater of total benefits cost. The HRC Foundation Corporate 
Equality Index looks to employers to provide equal benefits to LGBT employees and their families and 
does not penalize an employer if a particular benefit is not offered to any employees.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Until the passage of the federal Pension Protection Act of 2006, same-sex partners listed as 
beneficiaries to retirement plans were prohibited from rolling those retirement plans into their own 
individual retirement accounts, as opposite-sex spouses were able to do. The Internal Revenue Service 
issued guidance to employers on how to provide the retirement rollover option in early 2007, but that 
guidance came too late for the HRC Foundation to include the question on an informational basis in its 
2008 CEI survey. To read more about the Pension Protection Act, please visit www.hrc.org/1342.htm.

This year, businesses were asked about their retirement plan distribution options for informational 
purposes only. Forty-seven percent of CEI-rated businesses reported offering the rollover option to 
same-sex partners and 24 percent reported that the hardship distribution within their retirement plans 
was offered to same-sex partners. 

The HRC Foundation continued to survey employers with defined benefit plans (pensions) on whether 
they provided survivor options for domestic partners of employees, either in the form of Qualified 
Joint and Survivor Annuities or Qualified Pre-retirement Survivor Annuities. A total of 43 percent of 
participating employers indicated that they offer QJSAs to their employees’ domestic partners, while 27 
percent offer QPSAs. To read more, please visit www.hrc.org/issues/8813.htm.

LGBT Employee Resource Groups and Diversity Councils

The support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employee resource groups (also known as 
employee network groups or affinity groups) is a crucial step toward workplace equality — these groups 
foster a sense of community and team cohesion as well as provide leadership opportunities for LGBT 
employees to better their own work environments. Businesses usually provide these groups with a budget 
and access to resources such as meeting rooms and e-mail networks. The groups provide a clear line 
of communication between employees and management, ensuring that policies and practices have 
their intended effect. LGBT ERGs have been involved in policy-making, providing input on marketing 
and workplace protection policies, attracting and retaining talented individuals, leadership development, 
cultural change and representation at external events. In addition to giving guidance and input on LGBT-
specific workplace policies and practices, LGBT ERGs also help to provide a sense of safety and 
acceptance for LGBT employees within the workplace. 

Recognizing the differences in businesses rated in the CEI, criterion 4 can also be met with an 
organization-wide diversity council or working group with a mission that specifically includes LGBT 
diversity. However, most businesses garner credit in this section for having an ERG. 

More information on ERGs and helpful tips on forming them are available at the HRC Foundation’s 
website at  www.hrc.org/issues/GLBT_employee_groups.htm.

External Engagement

The HRC Foundation Corporate Equality Index rewards employers that demonstrate their commitment to 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers through engaging with and supporting the broader LGBT 
community. Such efforts include positive, targeted marketing and advertising, philanthropic activities and 
event sponsorships.

Many employers engage LGBT consumers directly through local or national marketing or advertising 
campaigns in LGBT media. Consumer-facing businesses are vying to capture a portion of the ever-
growing LGBT market, projected by Witeck-Combs Communications and Harris Interactive to grow 
from $723 billion in 2008 to $831 billion by 2011, while other businesses may engage in recruitment or 
awareness campaigns.

Philanthropic activities in the form of cash grants or in-kind donations of products or services may include 
contributions to such causes as LGBT health, education or political organizations or projects. These gifts 
often have a strategic long-term approach to a business’s bottom line; for example, official sponsors of the 
International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association include various airlines, travel and car rental operators, 
hotels and tourism associations. 

Similarly, event and conference sponsorships can provide businesses with targeted audiences that can 
assist their bottom line. For example, businesses that support LGBT pride celebrations in particular cities 
can establish local connections with LGBT consumers. 

82
of CEI-rated businesses report some form of external engagement with

media, sponsorship of LGBT events or financial or in-kind contributions to

LGBT policies and practices than previous cohorts. Professional job fairs such as these provide attendees

FINDINGS
Other Emerging Best Practices in LGBT Workplace Issues

Each year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index surveys employers on 
a variety of issues that are not included in the CEI rating to stay on the vanguard of LGBT workplace 
inclusion efforts.

15 of CEI-rated employers use LGBT-owned suppliers up from 12% last year. Of the 583 rated employers, 342 have supplier diversity programs, of which 26 percent include LGBT-owned suppliers. 

SELF-IDENTIFICATION
Unlike other diversity categories, such as race and gender, employers are not required to collect statistics 
on the number of LGBT people they employ. Employers have sought to determine the number of their 
employees who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender while balancing privacy concerns. Some 
employers use their LGBT employee group numbers to provide estimates, but this method is limited by 
the scope of such voluntary groups over a highly dispersed workforce.

More recently, employers have gathered statistics through anonymous employee engagement or 
satisfaction surveys.

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAMS 
Supplier diversity programs help firms identify smaller businesses owned primarily by minorities, 
including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of 
Commerce has certified LGBT-owned businesses since 2002 at www.nglcc.org. 

ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICIES 
In lieu of federal protections for LGBT employees, many businesses take more pro-active steps to ensure 
clear and robust policies to protect LGBT workers from discrimination or hostility. For the first time, the Human 
Rights Campaign Foundation asked informational questions about the inclusion of “sexual orientation” and 
“gender identity” or “gender identity or expression” in anti-harassment policies. While EEO/non-discrimination 
policies are typically considered the primary legal safety net for workers, anti-harassment policies can further 
elaborate on behavior that is not tolerated in the workplace. In addition, the inclusion of the terms helps human 
resource professionals, managers and other potential mediators fully grasp the issues involved should a conflict 
arise. Seventy-two percent of CEI-rated businesses include “sexual orientation” in their anti-harassment policies 
and 54 percent include “gender identity” or “gender identity or expression.”

36 of CEI-rated employers, 211 of all rated employers, use surveys or other tools that allow employees to voluntarily disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity, compared with 27 percent in the previous year. %

TRANSGENDER BENEFITS

13. Most health insurance policies — through what is referred to as a “transgender exclusion” clause   
 — deny or exclude coverage for commonplace treatments and procedures for transgender 
 employees that are otherwise covered for most employees.

 (benefit offered)?

 If so, is there at least one firm-sponsored insurance plan that does not exclude coverage 
 (transgender treatment covered) for medically-necessary treatment related to gender dysphoria 
 or gender reassignment?8

 >> This question requires examining your insurance policy’s list of coverage exclusions. Answering  
  “Yes, benefit offered, transgender treatment covered” for the following benefits indicates that  
  medically necessary care for gender reassignment would be covered under one or more insurance  
  plans available to your employees, or through some form of self-insurance.

 Paid short-term leave for surgical procedures9 
  ❑ Yes, benefit offered, transgender treatment covered
  ❑ No, benefit offered, but transgender treatment excluded
  ❑ No, benefit not offered
