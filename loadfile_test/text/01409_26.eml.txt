I connection with the copies of the Confirmation(s) you provided to me the other day -- the following Counterparty may also have confirmation(s):

				Norske Skog Canada Limited (f/n/a Fletcher Challenge Canada Limited -- for which you already provided the materials

				Norske Skog Canada Limited (f/n/a Pacifica Papers Inc.) -- for which a trade was done 1/8/2001  

ENA does not have a master in place for the above-mentioned, therefore, the confirmations, will provide the information needed for review.
In light of this, please make sure your Confirmation copy includes the GTC.   Further, please provide a copy of all confirmations for those trades which are live, active and on the books.


This request must be handled on an immediate basis, so could we have the copies by the close of business today -- January 16th.

Thanks,

Susan
