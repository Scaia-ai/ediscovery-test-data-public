Business Purpose

Gas to cover swing sale obligation to City of Tallahassee.  Swing sale (priced at gas daily plus $0.10) is part of underlying baseload sales transaction.


Economic Justification

MTM value of the COT contract to ENA is estimated at $24 MM based on curves as of 1/30/02

Incremental swing sale is priced at Gas Daily plus of $0.10.  Although we have to purchase supply at fixed price that price below is approximately where we expect Gas Daily to settle.  As result, incremental sale will generate a small margin.


Est. Purchase of Gas from Reliant	($2.25) x 2,000 x 5 days = ($22,500)

Est. Sale of Gas to City of Tall.           $2.30 x  2,000 x  5 days = $23,000
Est. Profit							         $500
.



Risks

Not delivering the gas would put ENA in breach of performance under the COT contract
