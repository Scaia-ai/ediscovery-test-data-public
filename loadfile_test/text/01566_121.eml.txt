Rhonda,

Thanks for the Southern document.  

Have you any word on the VEPCO document?

Also, please furnish a list and copies of those agreements for Power relating to your arrangements concerning  "payment & close-out netting"

Thanks.

Susan

Here's Southern.  I never received a copy of the Virginia Electric Master Netting.  We do have netting within the EEI.
