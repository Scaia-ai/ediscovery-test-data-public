Sara,

As in our past exercises for the "Non-Terminated/In-the-Money" Counterparties, the Thiele-Kaolin Company continues to appear as a "financial" trading relationship.

However, according to the Confirmation Desk there are only physical arrangements with this counterparty (as evidenced by our GTC docs).  I hope that Credit can resolve the mystery???

We cannot locate any financial contracts for this counterparty.

Please verify that this party belongs on the ITM Non-terminated financial gas list.
