Executive Summary
“It is not the strongest species that survives nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” -
Charles Darwin

The economic conditions of 2008 and undoubtedly 2009 will go down in history as the worst economic slump 
since the Great Depression.  And since Information Technology wasn’t around in 1929, this is arguably the worst 
economic downturn for IT in history.  

Like others my age, many in IT will recall the economic downturns over the past 20 years (or more, but I am not 
going to date myself), where the IT organization was considered a safe haven for employment, and viewed by 
the company as the life boat, providing innovation to help the business position itself properly for the next 
business upswing.  

Now that organizations have options and alternatives such as IT outsourcing, off-shoring, new business models 
and IT service delivery mechanisms, it is incumbent on any vestiges of remaining IT to optimize its own 
processes and itself in order to validate and confirm its contribution to the value chain of the business it serves.  
As many in the industry painfully understand now, the IT organization is no longer immune from this or future 
recessions and/or business cycle downturns.  

A wise man once told me; “It takes ignorance to take something simple and make it complex, but it takes a 
genius to take something complex and make it simple”.  ITIL isn’t necessarily a complex subject, but it has been 
made overly complex leading to misapplication and misguidance resulting in a number of failures.  The current 
"back to basics" trend suggests people and organizations want real lasting strategies, approaches, 
methodologies and technologies that make sense.

This whitepaper is intended to provide insights and ideas into how Business Process Management, or BPM, an 
already established process enabling technology, can be applied to IT processes as a means of simplifying, 
driving costs from, and optimizing your IT organization.

BPM Explained
Most people guess the “BP” correctly but opinions vary on the “M”.  Some say “Modeling”, “Monitoring”, and 
others “Measurement”.  Actually - Business Process Management encompasses all these things and typically at 
the root of it all is the concept of models.

Business Process Management (BPM) is a set of methodologies and technologies designed to support explicit 
business processes, right from analysis and definition to orchestration/execution, monitoring and optimization 
of business processes. The BPM market was formed from the opinion that business must be managed from a 
process point of view.  The rest of the business world actually drove the creation and demand for BPM.  BPM
vendors provide technology that deliver “Model driven process execution” as opposed to code-based execution.  
Gartner Group advises that this is the best way to enable business and IT professionals to manage and change 
processes collaboratively, especially in a volatile business environment1.

ITIL® is about formalizing and optimizing the way in which we (in IT) behave and work.  Process execution and 
improvement requirements are often unique to each organization, even when adopting ITIL® best practices. This 
obviously favors a “Build” vs. “Buy” approach to supporting technology.  Unfortunately, time frames and costs 
are not compatible with this level of process improvement.  BPM is the alternative approach to “Build” and
“Buy” that delivers flexibility and uniqueness of “Build”, while at the same time providing the time value, 
standardization and reduced cost of “Buy”.

The basic value proposition of BPM is the ability to enable processes with less effort and cost, with higher quality
than traditional means. In fact, BPM is intended to respond to the following set of business values:

• Agility: The ability to bring new products and services to market more quickly and adapt processes more 
effectively to changing market demands

• Efficiencies: Most processes are inefficient due to manual effort, poor hand-offs between departments and 
a general inability to monitor overall progress. The deployment of BPM solutions helps to eliminate these 
problems. The efficiency benefits are typically expressed in the reduced number of Full Time Employee’s 
(FTE’s) required to perform particular tasks

• Visibility: Providing management insight into process-based performance indicators. This enables an 
organization to make better business decisions and handle exceptions better.

Gartner research indicates that even without process redesign, a basic investment in a BPM suite yields
significant returns. By simply “making the current-state handoffs, timing and responsibilities explicit, 
productivity improvements of more than 12 percent are normally realized2”. In another report, Gartner indicates 
that 78% of projects see an internal rate of return (IRR) of greater than 15%.  The same report indicates that 
these projects were deployed in very quick order (67% in less than six months, 50% in less than four months).  

BPM has proven in almost every case to increase efficiency, effectiveness and agility.

As a management discipline, BPM emphasizes modeling the business from a cross-functional process 
perspective and establishing performance goals from that perspective as well. Years ago Dr. Geary Rummler 
called this “managing the white space in the organization chart,” and it remains central to the process 
perspective today.

To some management consultants, BPM begins and ends with process modeling, but there’s much more. 
Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) solutions provide the technology platform that takes models and 
metrics, defined by the business, turning them into an orchestrated and executable implementation. This 
platform actually automates the human workflow, integrates data between disparate backend systems, and 
executes the business rules, defined and controlled by the process model. And while it’s executing the business 
process, the system continuously records snapshots of data that allow the process to be measured end-to-end, 
as well as in real time, and corrected easily when the need arises.

Modeling as a Science (and art)
Modeling is a formal means of documenting the artifacts, relationships, goals, steps and states of the end-to-end 
process.  Documenting processes in a way that can be understood across functional units, geographic units and 
divisions of the enterprise.  Processes can easily be analyzed for cost, quality and efficiency improvements which 
is a key feature of BPM as a new management discipline. 

Process modeling is inherently a business function, and modeling technologies empower the business to define 
the steps, and the performance metrics.  While there is an art to model layout and construction, methods and 
standards are employed and followed for consistency and structure.  The most important thing to understand is 
that a model is not just an illustration or graphic.  The objects and links in a model represent objects and 
relationships that are re-usable, can be abstracted, related, measured, etc.  In other words, a model is a window 
of something larger that cannot be viewed in two dimensions in its entirety.   The following are just three 
examples of various types of models.

components, processes, and objects that live on them.

Most modern modeling tools support not only publishing complete and consistent process documentation in 
various formats, but also provide a means of process analysis through various tools such as simulation.  This 
allows “what if” analysis and process improvement initiatives that yield real business analysis metrics –
resources, cost, units, etc.

Inefficiencies in IT (why IT needs “Optimized” in the first place)
Business Process Management technologies obviously cannot solve all issues that result in IT “sub-optimization”.  
Some are rooted in poor management practice, organizational challenges, and barriers that completely derail 
optimization efforts.  Obviously management support and involvement is necessary for optimization to take 
place.  Other “usual suspects” of IT sub-optimization include:

Lack of adoption and understanding of a process culture
Obviously the “people” component of processes and IT optimization require that where there are human 
“actors” or customers of the process, they must understand their part in the processes and workflows, the 
metrics, control objectives, goals, owners and most importantly, their role within the process. Process defects 
are usually a result of people incorrectly executing a process, or supporting technology that does not enforce or 
detect process controls.

Processes operating in isolation
As Dr. Geary Rummler stated in his book “Improving Performance – How to manage the white space on the 
organization chart”, it’s the organizational white space often missed as technology and process are implemented 
in vertical, stove pipe fashion.  Process integrations and opportunities to integrate are often missed, and there is 
little to no process improvement possibilities where processes have been organizationally “stove piped” or 
implemented within vertical technologies.

Atrophied process initiatives that have failed to demonstrate value 
Many ITSM programs start with Incident, Problem, or Change and Configuration Management and then stop.  
Why this happens is subject for debate.  One reason might be that technology solutions are selected based on 
the requirements of the upfront processes that are known at the beginning of the project.  Since processes to be 
implemented later aren’t included in the requirements, tool selection results in an optimized tool for the initial
processes – but a technology that sub-optimizes or completely omits support for future processes.

Managing artifacts but not processes
The problem with implementing many different solutions to address process execution is that integrations
typically transfer artifacts such as incidents, changes, and configuration items, but miss process metrics and 
information - metrics that are typically used to measure and manage the process itself.  As a result, process 
metrics and measurements are not typically incorporated into the integration design.

BPM for Service Strategy and Design
Modeling Strategy through Principles.
When ITIL® Version 3 was kicked off, the road show actually included a model that decomposed the Deming 
Circle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) into sub-domains.  One could argue this is a “meta-model” (model of a model) 
describing the “supporting” artifacts within the scope of each step of the Deming circle.

From a Strategy perspective, these items can be captured in 
model and object form, reused in other models
different ways to other models for other purposes.  For example:
Policies and Principles can be captured, related, grouped,

Summary
Never before has business and IT been under such tremendous pressure to transform itself and make decisions 
based on actual value contribution to its customers.  This new reality requires a level of IT optimization that is no 
longer an optional decision.  Business Process Management Suites (BPMS) have been providing demonstrable 
value to the business process and application side of the house for years.  Why it hasn’t made inroads into IT 
Service Management until now is an interesting question.  The majority of BPMS vendors rarely target internal IT 
organizations for IT process design and orchestration, missing out on huge opportunities for them to reduce cost 
and increase agility.

IT process documentation is costly to create, often ineffective and inconsistent, difficult to maintain, and usually 
ends up on a shelf or in an electronic store never to be touched again.  Technologies implemented to support 
these IT processes often fail to achieve alignment with the business, resulting in sub-optimization of the IT 
organization as a whole.  By leveraging BPM within the IT organization itself, opportunities to truly reduce 
operational costs, improve quality and capabilities, and increase capacity, will surface.  This is something 
organizations that have already leveraged BPM external to IT operations have already experienced.  As a result, 
not only is operational IT process documentation maintained and kept current – but is aligned with the business 
and actually drives the process orchestration technology.  This then results in a measureable means of 
optimizing IT.
