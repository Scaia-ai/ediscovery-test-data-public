	1.  Certain Definitions.  As used herein:

	(e)	"Exposure" for a Swap shall mean (1) if a payment amount under the Confirmation (or a payment amount under any other Swap) has been determined and is due but not yet paid, the amount of such payment, with the party due and owed such amount having Exposure to the other party in such amount; and (2) the Current Value of the Swap, with the party that would be due and owed such amount from the other party having Exposure to the other party in such amount.

	(q)	Defined terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Confirmation to which this Annex is attached.


	2.  Performance Assurance.


(a)	On any Business Day, the Exposed Party may demand in writing that the Non-Exposed Party establish and maintain (subject to increase as provided below) (1) Performance Assurance for the benefit of the Exposed Party equal to the Non-Exposed Party’s Collateral Requirement, rounded up to the next higher integral multiple of $25,000 with respect to Counterparty, and $250,000 with respect to ENA, or (2) increase the amount of any outstanding Performance Assurance so that after such increase the Collateral Requirement has been fully satisfied.  The Non-Exposed Party shall either establish such Performance Assurance or increase any outstanding Performance Assurance, in each case by either (i) increasing the amount of any outstanding Letter of Credit; (ii) establishing additional Letters of Credit; or (ii) delivering Cash to the Exposed Party.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, Performance Assurance demanded of the Non-Exposed Party by 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a Business Day shall be provided by the close of business on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that Letters of Credit shall be Transferred by the close of business on the second succeeding Business Day.
(b)	On any Business Day (but no more frequently than weekly), a party (the “Requesting Party”) that has provided Performance Assurance to the other party (the “Non-Requesting Party”) may request a reduction in the amount of Performance Assurance previously provided by it, provided that, after the requested reduction in Performance Assurance, (i) the Requesting Party shall then have a Collateral Requirement of zero; (ii) if at such time there are outstanding Swaps between the parties or unsatisfied obligations from the Requesting Party to the Non-Requesting Party exist with respect to any Swaps, the Non-Requesting Party shall either be holding Performance Assurance or shall have had Performance Assurance issued for its benefit in an amount equal to the aggregate of any Additional Amounts applicable to the Requesting Party; (iii) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the Requesting Party shall have occurred and be continuing; and (iv) no Early Termination Date for which any unsatisfied payment obligations of the Requesting Party exist has occurred or been designated as a result of an Event of Default with respect to the Requesting Party.  A permitted reduction in Performance Assurance shall be effected by either the Transfer of Cash to the Requesting Party or the reduction of the amount of an outstanding Letter of Credit previously issued for the benefit of the Non-Requesting Party. The Requesting Party shall have the right to specify the means of effecting the reduction in Performance Assurance. The Non-Requesting Party shall have two (2) Business Days to effect a permitted reduction in Performance Assurance if such reduction is to be effected by the return of Cash to the Requesting Party.  If a permitted reduction in Performance Assurance is to be effected by a reduction in the amount of an outstanding Letter of Credit previously issued for the benefit of the Non-Requesting Party, then the Non-Requesting Party shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to a commensurate reduction in the amount of such Letter of Credit and shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to effectuate such reduction.  In all cases, the cost and expense of reducing Performance Assurance (including but not limited to the reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of the Non-Requesting Party) shall be borne by the Requesting Party.


3.  Cash Collateral.	 Performance Assurance in the form of United States Dollars (“Cash”) shall be subject to the following provisions:


(a)	Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, Cash shall be delivered in accordance with this Annex and to such account specified by the Exposed Party in the demand sent to the Non-Exposed Party pursuant to Section 2 of this Annex. 

	(b)	So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party has occurred and is continuing, and no Early Termination Date for which any unsatisfied payment obligations of the Non-Exposed Party exist has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party and to the extent that an obligation to deliver Performance Assurance would not be created or increased by the Transfer, the Exposed Party will Transfer to the Non-Exposed Party, in lieu of any interest, dividends or other amounts paid or deemed to have been paid with respect to the Cash (all of which may be retained by the Exposed Party), the Interest Amount (as defined above) on the last Business Day of each calendar month.  On or after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party or an Early Termination Date as a result of an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party, the Exposed Party shall retain any such Interest Amount as additional Cash hereunder until the obligations of the Exposed Party under the Confirmation have been satisfied.

(c)	Without limiting the Exposed Party’s rights under Section 8(d) of this Annex, the Exposed Party will exercise reasonable care to assure the safe custody of all Cash to the extent required by applicable law, and in any event the Exposed Party will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care if it exercises at least the same degree of care as it would exercise with respect to its own property.  Except as specified in the preceding sentence, the Exposed Party will have no duty with respect to Cash.


4.  Letters of Credit.	 Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit shall be subject to the following provisions:


(a)	Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, a Letter of Credit shall be provided in accordance with this Annex, and the Letter of Credit shall be maintained for the benefit of the Exposed Party.  The Non-Exposed Party or the Issuer of the Letter of Credit shall (i) renew or cause the renewal of each outstanding Letter of Credit on a timely basis as provided in the relevant Letter of Credit, (ii) if the Issuer of an outstanding Letter of Credit has indicated its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, provide either a substitute Letter of Credit or other substitute Performance Assurance, in each case at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the expiration of the outstanding Letter of Credit, and (iii) if the Issuer shall fail to honor the Exposed Party’s properly documented request to draw on an outstanding Letter of Credit, provide for the benefit of the Exposed Party either a substitute Letter of Credit that is issued by a bank acceptable to the Exposed Party or other substitute Performance Assurance, in each case within two (2) Business Days after such refusal.


(b)	Upon the occurrence of a Letter of Credit Default, the Non-Exposed Party agrees to either cause another Issuer to deliver to the Exposed Party a substitute Letter of Credit, or alternatively, the Non-Exposed Party shall provide other Performance Assurance, in each case on or before the second Business Day after the occurrence thereof (or the fifth (5th) Business Day after the occurrence thereof if only clause (i) under the definition of Letter of Credit Default applies).


(c)	When providing Performance Assurance, the Non-Exposed Party may increase the amount of an outstanding Letter of Credit or establish one or more additional Letters of Credit.


(d)	Upon or at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party, the Exposed Party may draw on the entire, undrawn portion of any outstanding Letter of Credit upon submission to the Issuer of one or more certificates specifying that such Event of Default has occurred in accordance with the specific requirements of the Letter of Credit.  Cash proceeds received from drawing upon the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be Performance Assurance as security for the Non-Exposed Party’s obligations to the Exposed Party (and the Non-Exposed Party hereby pledges and grants to the Exposed Party as security for such obligations a first lien, priority security interest in and to such cash proceeds) and the Exposed Party shall have the rights and remedies set forth in Section 6 herein with respect to such cash proceeds.  Notwithstanding the Exposed Party’s receipt of Cash under the Letter of Credit, the Non-Exposed Party shall remain liable to the Exposed Party (y) for any failure to Transfer sufficient Performance Assurance and (z) for any amounts due and owing to the Exposed Party and remaining unpaid after the application of the amounts so drawn by the Exposed Party.


(e)	The Non-Exposed Party may substitute a Letter of Credit for one or more other outstanding Letter(s) of Credit issued for the benefit of the Exposed Party, provided that the amount of such substitute Letter of Credit shall be at least equal to that of the Letter(s) of Credit being replaced (determined in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner by the Exposed Party), and provided further that no Letter of Credit shall be canceled unless and until the Letter of Credit to be substituted therefor shall have been validly executed and issued for the benefit of the Exposed Party in accordance with applicable law.


(f)	In all cases, the costs and expenses (including but not limited to the reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of the Exposed Party) of establishing, renewing, substituting, canceling, and increasing the amount of (as the case may be) one or more Letters of Credit shall be borne by the Non-Exposed Party.


	5.  Additional Representation.  Each party continuously represents and warrants to the other party that (a) it has the power and authority under the law of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation and under its organizational and constituent documents to grant to the other party, a valid, enforceable, first-priority security interest in, and lien on, all Performance Assurance (other than Letters of Credit) that it provides as the Non-Exposed Party to the other party hereunder and has taken all necessary actions to authorize the granting of that security interest and lien; (b) as of each date on which it, as the Non-Exposed Party, delivers Performance Assurance to the Exposed Party or to any agent of the Exposed Party for the benefit of the Exposed Party (or, in the case of after-acquired Cash, at the time the Exposed Party or its agent acquires rights therein), it will have title to and will be the sole owner of such Performance Assurance, free and clear of any security interest, lien, pledge, charge, encumbrance, or other interests or restrictions other than the security interest granted to the Exposed Party hereby; (c) the Exposed Party will have a valid and perfected first-priority security interest in, and lien on, all Performance Assurance (other than Letters of Credit) upon receipt thereof; (d) the performance by it of its obligations under this Annex will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on any property other than the security interest and lien granted pursuant to this Annex; and (e) on each occasion that it, as the Non-Exposed Party, causes the issuance, renewal, substitution, or increase (as the case may be) of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit will be the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Issuer thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

		6.  Exposed Party’s Rights and Remedies.    If at any time (i) an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party has occurred and is continuing or (ii) an Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as a result of an Event of Default with respect to the Non-Exposed Party, then the Exposed Party may do any one or more of the following: (x) exercise any of the rights and remedies of a secured party with respect to the Performance Assurance provided by the Non-Exposed Party to it hereunder, including any such rights and remedies under law then in effect; (y) exercise its rights of setoff against any and all property of the Non-Exposed Party in the possession of the Exposed Party or its agent; or (z) draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit.  The Exposed Party shall either (y) apply the proceeds of the Performance Assurance realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce the Non-Exposed Party’s obligations under the Confirmation and all outstanding Swaps (the Non-Exposed Party remaining liable for any amounts owing to the Exposed Party after such application), subject to the Exposed Party’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after such obligations are satisfied in full or (z) hold such proceeds as collateral security for the Non-Exposed Party’s obligations to the Exposed Party under the Confirmation and all outstanding Swaps.

		7.  Security Interest.  To secure its obligations under the Confirmation and all outstanding Swaps, the Non-Exposed Party hereby grants to the Exposed Party a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right of setoff against), all Performance Assurance (other than Letters of Credit) and any and all proceeds, to the extent not otherwise Transferred to the Exposed Party, resulting from such Performance Assurance, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the Exposed Party, and the Non-Exposed Party agrees to take such action as the Exposed Party reasonably requires in order to perfect the Exposed Party’s first-priority continuing security interest in, and lien on (and right of setoff against), such Performance Assurance (other than Letters of Credit) and any and all proceeds resulting from such Performance Assurance.

8.  General.

(a) 	Except as expressly set forth in this Annex or the Confirmation, each party will pay its own costs and expenses in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex and neither party will be liable for any costs or expenses incurred by the other party in connection herewith.

(b)	The Exposed Party will promptly pay when due all taxes, assessments or charges of any nature that are imposed with respect to Performance Assurance held by the Exposed Party upon becoming aware of the same, regardless of whether any portion of that Performance Assurance is subsequently disposed of under Section 6 of this Annex, except for those taxes, assessments and charges that result from the exercise of the Exposed Party’s rights under Section 8(d) of this Annex.

(c)	All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Exposed Party in connection with the liquidation and/or application of any Performance Assurance under Section 6 of this Annex will be payable on demand and pursuant to the Confirmation and this Annex by the Non-Exposed Party.

(d)	So long as the Exposed Party is not a Defaulting Party and no Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as a result of an Event of Default with respect to the Exposed Party, then the Exposed Party shall have the right to sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise use in its business, any Cash it holds, free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of the Non-Exposed Party, including any equity or right of redemption by the Non-Exposed Party.

Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under the Contract (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and, except to the extent specifically provided in the Contract, in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, tort, or any other damages, costs, or attorney’s fees.

The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty shall not exceed U.S. $15,000,000  (the “Guaranty Cap”).

The Guaranty Cap shall not be affected by the holding or application of any collateral or other credit support by Counterparty.


2.  DEMANDS AND NOTICE.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Termination Event, as may be defined in any Contract, if Enron fails or refuses to pay any Obligations and Counterparty has elected to exercise its rights under this Guaranty, Counterparty shall make a demand upon Guarantor (hereinafter referred to as a “Payment Demand”).  A Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount Enron has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific statement that Counterparty is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guaranty. A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must pay the Obligations within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the Payment Demand. A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default, until Enron or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured.  As used herein, the term “Business Day” shall mean a day on which commercial banks or financial institutions are open for business in Houston, Texas and New York, New York.


3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:

(a)  it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the Guaranty; 

(b)  no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty; and

(c)  this Guaranty, when executed and delivered, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor, except as the enforceability of this Guaranty may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.


4.  SETOFFS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.  Without limiting Guarantor’s own defenses and rights hereunder, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses to which Enron or any other affiliate of Guarantor is or may be entitled to arising from or out of the Contract or otherwise, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Enron.


5.  AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.


6.  WAIVERS.  Except as required in Section 2 above, Guarantor hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Guarantor; and (c) any right to require that any action or proceeding be brought against Enron or any other person, or to require that Counterparty seek enforcement of any performance against Enron or any other person, prior to any action against Guarantor under the terms hereof.


Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.


Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Contract.


Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to Counterparty and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination shall be effective until five (5) Business Days after receipt by Counterparty of such termination notice.
