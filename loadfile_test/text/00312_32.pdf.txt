 Business Policies  

· Use the Auto Advisor tool to access recommendations for classes that are 
required by your degree plan and to quickly enroll in one or more of these 
classes without searching the GoArmyEd Integrated Course Schedule.   

· Caution: If you have transfer credits that have not yet been evaluated by your 
home college, check with your college before enrolling in a course 
recommended by the Auto Advisor. Your college can confirm that the course is 
not one that you have already completed. 

· This feature is not available to “External Degree Plan” or “Other Degree Plan” 
Soldiers because Auto Advisor uses data from degrees that are fully set up in 
GoArmyEd to make its recommendations.

9.  The Enrollment Request Information page displays.  Review the information 

about the cost of your selected course.

courses can be processed directly through GoArmyEd only if the Student 
Amount field shows a balance.  The college bills you directly if you owe any 
tuition that is not paid by GoArmyEd.  Always check the Student Amount field 
to determine whether you must self-pay for a portion of the class cost.

 Key Points to Remember  

· If your previous transcripts have not been evaluated, contact your college before 
enrolling in a course that appears in Auto Advisor.  Your college can confirm that 
the course in which you want to enroll is required for your degree plan. 

· A course can have a variety of class types (e.g., TA Online, Classroom, and 
eArmyU) that specify delivery options.  Be sure to view the class details for each 
course before you enroll. 

· Always check the Student Amount field to determine whether you must self-pay 
for a portion of the cost of the class.
