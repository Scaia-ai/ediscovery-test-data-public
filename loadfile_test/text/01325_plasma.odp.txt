INTRODUCTION TO THE STATES OF MATTER

	Matter comes in four* states that are distinguished by the strength of the bonds holding the molecules of the matter together.


	They are solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.


	*Some scientists say that there are more than four states of matter.





CHARACTERISTICS OF PLASMA

	Plasma is usually a conductive assembly of charged particles, neutrals and fields that exhibit collective effects.


	Plasma may also carry electrical currents and generate magnetic fields.


	Plasma temperatures range from relatively cool to very hot.


	Plasma densities range from tenuous to dense.






INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT PLASMA

	The plasma physics includes basic physics research, industrial plasma processing, controlled fusion experiments, and astrophysical and geophysical plasma research.


	It is estimated that roughly 99.5% of the matter in the universe is in the plasma state.


	Sir William Crookes, an English physicist, identified plasma as the fourth state of matter in 1879.






UNIQUENESS OF PLASMA

	Plasma is the most common form of matter.


	Ordinary solids, liquids, and gases are all electrically neutral and too cool or dense to be identified as plasma.






EVERYDAY APPLICATIONS OF PLASMA

	New manufacturing techniques


	Consumer products


	The prospect of abundant energy


	More efficient lighting


	Surface cleaning


	Waste removal





FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF PLASMA

	Nuclear fusion


	Prosthetic body parts


	Production of artificial skin grafts


	Sterilization of food surfaces and medical instruments.





EXAMPLES OF PLASMA	

	Interplanetary medium


	Stellar Interiors


	Ionosphere


	Electrons in a metal


	The gas in an electrical arc


	Lightning
