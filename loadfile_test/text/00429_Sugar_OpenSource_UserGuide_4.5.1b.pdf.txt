Preface

Welcome to Sugar Suite, an open source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
application.

Sugar Suite enables organizations to efficiently organize, populate, and maintain 
information on all aspects of their customer relationships. It provides integrated 
management of corporate information on customer accounts and contacts, sales leads 
and opportunities, plus activities such as calls, meetings, and assigned tasks.The 
system seamlessly blends all of the functionality required to manage information on 
many aspects of your business into an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.

The system also offers a graphical dashboard to track the sales pipeline, the most 
successful lead sources, and the month-by-month outcomes for opportunities in the 
pipeline.

Sugar Suite is based on an open source project, and therefore, advances quickly 
through the development and contribution of new features by its supporting 
community.

 Welcome to the community!

About this Guide
The Sugar Open Source User Guide is designed for users who are new to Sugar Suite, 
or to CRM and Web-based applications. This guide introduces you to some basic 
CRM concepts and helps you get familiar with the Sugar Suite system. It describes 
how to access Sugar Suite through a personal computer and a Web browser to perform 
iSugar Open Source User Guide

a broad range of customer relationship management tasks. 

Readers are not required to have any programming or software development 
knowledge, but should be generally familiar with the use of a personal computer and a 
Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.

Audience
The Sugar Open Source User Guide provides information for users who want to 
record and track company activities and outcomes. In addition, this guide provides 



Preface
information for system administrators who manage user access and system 
configuration.

Overview
Sugar Suite consists of modules, each of which represents a specific functional aspect 
of CRM such as Accounts, Activities, Leads, and Opportunities. For example, the 
Accounts module enables you to create and manage customer accounts, and the 
Activities module enables you to create and manage activities related to accounts, 
opportunities, etc. These modules are designed to help you manage customer accounts 
through each step of their lifecycle, starting with generating and qualifying leads to 
customer support and resolving reported bugs. Because many of these steps are 
interrelated, each module displays related information. For example, when you view 
the details of a particular account, the system also displays the related contacts, 
activities, opportunities, and bugs. You can not only view and edit this information but 
also create new information.

As an administrator, you have the power to implement access control for these 
modules. You can customize the look and feel of Sugar Suite across your organization. 
You can even create new modules if needed. You can also create multiple forums as 
platforms of discussion on various topics amongst your users and customers.

Interface Consolidation

The Portal module allows administrators and users to link external web sites and web 
applications into the Sugar Suite user interface, enabling Sugar Suite to become a 
unified information interface for its users. 

Sugar Suite is built on established open-source technologies and widely supported 
industry standards, including the PHP development environment, the MySQL 
relational database, the Apache or IIS web servers, and the Linux or Windows Server 
operating systems. The system supports both the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, 
PHP) and WIMP (Windows, IIS, MySQL, PHP) platforms.

What’s New in 4.5.1 
With each revision of the Sugar Suite software, significant advances are made in both 
the feature set and usability of the software. Some of the highlights of version 4.5.1 
are detailed below.

Campaign Management

Sugar now offers the following features for campaigns:
z Create Newsletter campaigns. A Newsletter campaign is an email campaign that 

you can send out on a regular basis.
z A Campaign Wizard that enables you to create an email campaign, a newsletter 

campaign, or other types such as mail and telesales campaigns. 
z A new Email campaign diagnostic tool allows you to ensure that all the campaign 

requirements have been met such as email setup, bounce-handling mailbox, and a 
scheduled job to send out the campaign emails. The diagnostic tool allows users to

the campaign.

z An embedded ROI report that allows you to view the Return on Investment (ROI)

Getting Started

This guide assumes that the resources needed to access the Sugar Suite system are 
available to you and that you are familiar with how to use them. If you are not sure 
whether your system meets the requirements or how to use required third-party tools, 
such as a Web browser, talk to your manager or system administrator. 

Topics include:
z “Technical Requirements” on page 1
z “Accessing Sugar Suite” on page 2
z “Setting Your Preferences” on page 3
z “Security Timeout” on page 7
z “Managing Your Password” on page 7

Technical Requirements
Before you begin using the system, ensure that you have the required software 
installed and configured on your system as follows:
1. A current Web browser on your computer.

Sugar Suite has been successfully tested on the following browsers. 

Web Browser Version URL

Mozilla 1.7 and higher www.mozilla.org/mozilla 1.x
1Sugar Open Source User Guide

You may encounter problems if you try to access Sugar Suite using older Web 
browser versions such as Internet Explorer 4 or Netscape 4.x. If you are unsure 
about which version you are using, click Help > About or similar options on the 
menu bar in your browser to display the version number.

2. Enable Java Script and cookie support on your Web browser.



Chapter 1 Getting Started

your browser and is usually turned on by default. If you encounter problems 
accessing the system, check your browser configuration to ensure both Java Script 
support and cookie support are enabled as follows:
| Internet Explorer: Click Tools > Internet Options > Privacy and Security tabs,
| Firefox: Click Tools > Options > Privacy and Web Features tabs.

3. Network access to a server that is running the Sugar Suite software.
Your system or network administrator can provide you with a Web address (URL) 
from which the system can be accessed. 

Note: For detailed information on supported versions for all the Sugar Suite 
components, see the Compatibility Matrix in the Release Notes.

Web Browser and Window Controls
Sugar Suite dynamically generates the HTML screens that the Web browser displays 
when you click certain buttons on a Web page. These screens may not display if you 
use the Web browser’s Backward and Forward buttons. Therefore, it is recommended 
that you use the Shortcuts menu or the module tabs to navigate back and forth in the 
application.

Sugar Suite is designed for a minimum 1024x768-pixel screen display resolution.

Accessing Sugar Suite 
You access Sugar Suite through a Web browser. 

To log into the system:
1. Enter the Sugar Suite URL in the address bar of your Web browser.

The Login window displays. If the login screen does not display, verify that you 
have typed the URL correctly, or contact your system administrator to verify that 
you have the correct URL
By default, the Sugar application uses the Sugar theme and the US English 
language pack. For more information on themes, see “Common Module Options” 
on page 13.

2. Enter your user name and password.
The system administrator assigns a user name and password to every system user. 
If you have not received your user name and password, contact your system 
administrator.
If you cannot log in, take one of the following actions as appropriate:
| Verify that the user name and password are correct, including any capital 

letters. 
| Verify with your system administrator that you have the correct user name and 

password.
2 Sugar Open Source User Guide



Setting Your Preferences
| Contact your system administrator to ensure that your account has not been 
disabled.

3. If applicable, select the language and theme that you want to use. 
You can also choose the language that you want to use when working in the 
system and the theme or visual appearance you want the system to have. 
Languages and themes can be found at http://www.sugarforge.org/.

4. Click Login.
The time zone drop-down list displays. 

5. Select your time zone from the drop-down list and click Save.

The Sugar Suite Home page displays. The figure below illustrates the default Sugar 
theme. For an overview of the Home module as well as other modules, see “Sugar 
Suite Modules” on page 11.

Setting Your Preferences
Typically, the administrator configures the system settings for all users in the 
organization. This includes user profile information, password, email settings, 
calendar settings, as well as specifying the module tabs to display to all or some users 
3Sugar Open Source User Guide

in the organization.



Chapter 1 Getting Started
On your My Account page, you can view the settings that the administrator has 
configured for you. This includes your contact information, locale settings, and your 
Sugar module privileges.

As a user, you can edit some of these settings, such as your contact information and 
layout options to configure your system to suit your requirements. However, you 
cannot display modules that the administrator has hidden from your view. 

By default, individual module tabs display in the user interface. However, if you are 
using the Sugar theme, you can display group tabs instead. Group tabs, configured by 
the administrator, organizes module tabs into groups according to your organization’s 
requirements. For example, the tabs for contacts, leads, and opportunities can be 
displayed under the Sales group tab. You can choose to display individual module tabs 
or group tabs. See “Layout Options” on page 5 for more information.

The screenshot below displays the default group tabs and the module tabs grouped 
under the Sales group tab.

To revert to the default system settings, click the Reset to Default Preferences link on 
the My Account page. Note that you will lose your customized settings when you do 
this.

To set or edit your profile and preferences
Click the My Account link located at the top right side of the page.

The Duplicate button displays only when an administrator logs in because only an 
4 Sugar Open Source User Guide

administrator can duplicate records. Duplicating records is a quick way to create a 



Setting Your Preferences
new record. You can create a duplicate record and then edit it and save it as a new 
record.

6. To edit the user profile or change your preferences, click the Edit button. 
In the Edit view, you can define or edit information in the following panels:
Header Information
You can edit your name, status, and user name.
User Settings
Use this panel to view your privileges and system settings that the administrator 
has configured. You can change some settings such as whether you want to be 
notified when you have been assigned a task. 
The administrator sets the default export settings such as the delimiter used to 
separate data in export files and the default character set used to export data from 
Sugar Suite. However, you can override the administrator’s settings with your 
own. The default character set to export data is CP1252. If your locale is not US or 
Western Europe, you must specify the appropriate character encoding for your 
locale. This ensures that the character set used by the Sugar system to create the 
exported file is mapped to the correct character set on your machine. For example, 
MS Windows uses SJIS in Japan. So, users in this locale will need to select SJIS 
as the default export character set instead of CP1252.
This character encoding setting is also used when importing data into Sugar Suite.
If you are an administrator, you can also assign yourself to the role of a Group 
User or Portal User through the User Management option on the Administration 
Home page.
Locale Settings
Use this panel to configure settings such as the time zone, date format, currency, 
and name display format. 
User Information
Use this panel to enter your work and contact information such as your title, 
department, phone numbers, and one of the following Instant Messenger (IM) 
services: MSN, Yahoo, or AOL.
Address Information
Use this panel to enter your primary address such as your home address.
Calendar Options
Use this panel to create a Publish Key. The system prompts anybody who attempts 
to publish your calendar for this key. 
Layout Options
Use this panel to specify the order in which module tabs display when you log into 
the Sugar Suite application. You can also hide modules that you do not need to 
use. By default, you have access to all the modules. To move up a module, select 
the module in the Display Tabs list and click the Up arrow; to move down the 
module, click the Down arrow. 
5Sugar Open Source User Guide



Chapter 1 Getting Started
To hide a module, move the module tab to the Hide Tabs list using the right arrow. 
Similarly, to display a module, use the left arrow to move it from the Hide Tabs 
list to the Display Tabs list. 
If you log in as the administrator, you can apply these settings globally by moving 
the modules from the Hide Tabs list to the Remove Tabs list. Any module in the 
Remove Tabs list is hidden not only from you but from all users in your 
organization. You can specify the maximum number of module and sub-module 
tabs to display. You can display the Last Viewed bar on the side or on the top. Use 
the Number of tabs to display box to specify the maximum number of module tabs 
to display in the User Interface.

Note: You cannot hide the Home module.

By default, module tabs are displayed individually in the user interface. However, 
if you are using the Sugar theme, you can organize module tabs under group tabs. 
To group them, select Grouped Modules from the Navigation Paradigm drop-
down list. To ungroup them, select Modules.
Email Options
Use this panel to set your email options such as your email address and the email 
client. 
You can choose the SugarCRM mail client, or an external mail client such as 
Microsoft Outlook. The default is the SugarCRM mail client. In addition, you can 
select an email format such as HTML or Plain Text. You can also choose to add 
your signature on your outbound emails. 
Outbound Email Settings
Use this panel to view or change the mail transfer agent for your outbound emails. 
You can select either Sendmail or SMTP.
Inbound Email Settings
Use this panel to specify mail server information such as its address, protocol, port 
number, status, user name and password. To ensure that the settings are accurate, 
click the Test Settings button.
Click Show Advanced to set the following options:

Use SSL. Select this box to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) when connecting 
to the mail server. 
Leave Messages on Server. Select this box to save your inbound messages 
on the email server instead of the Sugar Suite server.
Import only since last check. Select this box to instruct the system to import 
only email messages that are new since the last time you checked for 
messages. 

Note: Selecting this option could slow down performance because the server 
will check every message to ensure that you have not already read it.

7. Click Save to save your changes; click Cancel to exit without saving the changes.
6 Sugar Open Source User Guide



Security Timeout
To revert back to the default settings, click the Reset to Default Preferences link 
at the top right corner of the detail page and click OK to confirm your action.

Security Timeout
For security reasons, the system automatically logs you out of the system if you do not 
perform any tasks for a specified period of time. This timeout period is determined by 
two factors:
z The lifetime of the PHP Session Cookie (PHPSESSID). The default lifetime is 

until the browser is closed.
z The PHP session timeout period. The default value is 1440 seconds (24 minutes).

Therefore, if you do not perform any tasks for a certain time period, the system may 
log you out either because the browser session timed out or because PHP session 
timed out. 

When you are ready to resume working with the system, click any button on the 
screen. The system automatically loads the Login page for you. You can also close the 
Web browser windows and re-load the Login page manually in a new browser 
window.

Managing Your Password
When you are first granted access to the system, your administrator will provide you 
with a password. For security reasons, it is recommended that you change this 
password. Ensure that you choose a password that is easy for you to remember, but 
difficult for others to guess.

You can change your password at any time. For security reasons, it is recommended 
that you change your password periodically.

To change the password
1. Log into Sugar Suite and click the My Account link that displays at the top right 

of your screen. 
2. On the My Account screen, click Change Password.

In the Change Password dialog box, enter your new password in the New 
Password box, and again in the Confirm Password box.

3. Click Save to change the password.
7Sugar Open Source User Guide



Chapter 1 Getting Started
If you forget your password, contact your system administrator for a new 
password that you can use temporarily. You can then log into the system, and 
change the password to one of your choice according to the procedure described 
above.

Navigating the User Interface

This chapter describes the layout of the Sugar Suite user interface and presents an 
overview of the functionality.

Topics are as follows:
z “Overview of the Sugar Suite User Interface” on page 9
z “Viewing and Managing Record Information” on page 14
z “Managing Sugar Dashlets” on page 18
z “Merging Duplicate Records” on page 20
z “Searching for Information on Sugar Suite” on page 22

Overview of the Sugar Suite User Interface
The Sugar Suite user interface consists of various modules designed to help you 
manage customer-related records such as contacts. Each module, representing a record 
type, groups the tools and functions needed to perform specific tasks. This enables 
you to work more efficiently. 

Record types can be related to one another. For example, a contract is related to a 
specific account. When you view a specific record in Sugar Suite, the system also 
displays related records. Therefore, when you view a specific contract, information on 
the related account and contacts are also displayed in sub-panels.

When you log in, the Home module displays. Tabs for other modules display 
9Sugar Open Source User Guide



Chapter 2 Navigating the User Interface

z System links. System links, located at the top right-hand corner of the page, are 

common to most modules. They allow you to access your profile information, 
Sugar University, the employee list in your organization, Sugar Suite version 
information, and log out of the system. Administrators can view and access the 
Administration Home page to perform their tasks. For more information, see 
“System Links” on page 11.

z Module tabs. Module tabs allow you to access a module to view, create, and 
manage records. For more information, see “Sugar Suite Modules” on page 11.

z Last Viewed links. These links provide a trail of pages that were lasted viewed.

z Shortcuts. The Shortcuts menu allows you select options to view, create, and 
import item records. For more information, see “Common Module Options” on 
page 13.

z Dashlets. Dashlets are user-configurable panels on the Home page that allow you 
to specify the items that you want to view on your home page. For more 
information, see “Managing Sugar Dashlets” on page 18.

Chapter 2 Navigating the User Interface
z Home. The Home module provides a quick overview of your customer-related 
tasks and activities. For more information, see “Home Module” on page 29.

z My Portal. Click this tab to view the My Portal module. You use this module to 
create shortcuts to one or more Web sites. This is commonly used to include

Managing Sugar Dashlets
Dashlets are user-configurable panels on the Home page that allow you to specify the 
items that you want to view on your home page. A dashlet displays a list of item 
records that is similar to the list view displayed on a module’s home page. Sugar Suite 
displays a collection of dashlets for items such as meetings, activities, and accounts on 
your home page. You can configure each dashlet to display the rows, columns, and 
filters that you need. For example, you can change a dashlet’s title or choose to view 
only your items. You can add and remove dashlets as needed. 

You can add multiple dashlets of the same kind. For example, you can add multiple 
activity dashlets and configure each one differently. By default, you can add a 
maximum of 10 dashlets on your home page, but the administrator can change this 
setting. You can also move a dashlet to different locations on the page as required. 

Note: If you cannot add or move dashlets, check with the administrator to ensure 
that the functionality has been enabled.

Developers can extend its functionality to provide users with additional capabilities.

Merging Duplicate Records
If you have more than one record for an item, you can merge them to update and clean 
up your data. You can select which fields you want to merge and when the process 
completes, the system deletes the duplicate records. This ensures that there is no 
confusion and that your users are accessing information from only one source. Before 
the duplicate records are deleted, related information such as activities, history, 
contacts are moved from the duplicate records to the primary record.

You can merge duplicate records only in the following modules: Accounts, Contacts, 
Leads, Opportunities, Cases, and Bugs. You can merge five duplicate records at a 
time. 

If you already know of the duplicate records that you want to merge, you can do so 
from the module’s list view. If you need to search for duplicates of a record and then 
merge them, you can do it from the record’s detail view.

To merge duplicate records from the list view

Duplicates link.
The Merge Records page displays fields from primary record on the left and fields 
from the duplicate records on the right.

Searching for Information on Sugar Suite
You can search for information across Sugar Suite or restrict it to a specific module. 
You can also perform a quick search for a specific field value. 

You can perform the following types of searches in Sugar Suite:
z Global Search
z Basic Search
z Advanced Search

Global Search
You can perform a global keyword search at the system level for text that matches the 
beginning of key field names.
22 Sugar Open Source User Guide



Searching for Information on Sugar Suite
All searches in Sugar Suite automatically append the % wildcard character when 
searching text fields. 

For example, searching for “Acme” will match account names such as “Acme 
Industries” or “Acme Funds”. Searching for “%Acme” will also match account names 
such as “ABC Acme Industries”.

Depending on your database configuration, global searches may or may not be case-
sensitive. In general, global searches on Sugar Suite installations running on the 
MySQL database are not case-sensitive and those running on Oracle are case-
sensitive.

To perform a global search, enter the keyword in the Search field and click GO. The 
systems searches Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, Cases, and Projects and 
displays search results for each of these modules. If you want to search only some of 
these modules, click the down arrow and select the modules from the list and then 
click GO. 

The module with the most records displays at the top of the search results page

Basic Search
You can perform a basic keyword search within most modules. To perform a basic 
search, in the Search sub-panel on the module’s home page, enter values for one or 
more fields and click Search.
23Sugar Open Source User Guide



Chapter 2 Navigating the User Interface
To find only records that are related to your tasks and activities, select the Only My 
records box.

The search fields are context-sensitive and vary depending upon the module you are 
searching. When you type a character in a field, the system performs a quick search of 
possible values and presents a list of values starting with that character. Typing 
additional characters restricts the resulting list.

Text entered in search fields needs to match from the beginning of the value stored in 
each record unless the wildcard character is prepended. If text is entered in more than 
one search field, then a record must match on all those fields to be included in the 
filtered list. In other words, searching for “fred*” would only match first names like 
“Fred*erick” or other “Fred” names containing the asterisk (*) character.

These rules are also applicable to advanced search.

You can edit or delete records in the search results as described in “To edit or delete 
multiple records” on page 17.

Advanced Search
To further filter the search results, click the Advanced link below Search. The system 
displays additional fields that vary depending on the module you select. 

Note: Numeric search strings will match anywhere in a field. Then all matching 
records are displayed in a series of paginated lists.

Opportunities Module
Opportunities Module
Use the Opportunities module to create and manage sales opportunities for your 
organization.

Every opportunity must be associated with an account. You can associate an 
opportunity with only one account but you can associate it with multiple leads and 
contacts. 

An opportunity specifies the estimated sales amount for an account and is tied to a 
sales stage. A sales stage, such as Qualification, Closed Won, or Closed Lost identifies 
how close you are to making a sale. The administrator defines and sets the sales stage 
depending upon the requirements in your organization. The estimated sales amount 
can vary depending on the sales stage.

Based on the sales stage, the system calculates the probability of a sale. For example, 
at the Proposal sales stage, the system calculates the probability as 80%, and at the 
Negotiation sales stage, probability increases to 95%. 

You can associate an opportunity with a campaign to track the campaign’s 
effectiveness in generating opportunities for your organization. Any campaign-related 
opportunity that generates revenue is reflected in the campaign’s ROI (Return on 
Investment) chart. For more information, see “Viewing a Campaign’s Return on 
Investment” on page 91.

Note: You can associate an opportunity with only one campaign.

Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
Emails Module
Use the Email module to manage your inbound and outbound emails. 

Inbound emails are emails that you receive and outbound emails are emails that you 
send to other users or external parties such as your customers.

Users can monitor their own inbox for emails addressed to them. For emails that are 
addressed to the organization rather than a specific user, the administrator can create 
one or more group inboxes, such as support@company.com. The administrator or 
group users can distribute these emails to the appropriate users for necessary action. 
For more information on group users, see the Sugar Enterprise and Professional 
Administration Guide.

When you create an email, you can associate it with a specific record such as an 
account, case, or opportunity. If necessary, you can save the email as a draft and send 
it out at a later date. You can also archive it or export it, in .csv format, to your local 
machine for your records. 

You can create email templates to send out a standard email for a mass email 
campaign. The system extracts variables such as names and addresses from the 
campaign’s target records and merges them with the email template when you send 
out the email. For more information on email templates, see “Creating Email 
Templates” on page 73. For more information on email campaigns, see “Executing 
an Email Campaign” on page 81.

You can copy and archive emails that you send or receive through Sugar Suite, 
Microsoft Outlook, or other email systems. Archiving emails allows you to store 
records of customer interactions in a convenient location. For more information on 
archiving, see “Archiving Emails” on page 71.

Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
Campaigns Module
Use the Campaigns Module to track and manage mass marketing campaigns.

You can create many types of campaigns as described in “Creating a Campaign” on 
page 79.

From Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities modules, you can associate a record with an 
existing campaign. 

Typically, a mass marketing campaign targets a large group of individuals or 
organizations. Therefore, the campaign process begins with identifying the targets. 
You can group multiple targets into a target list according to a set of predetermined 
criteria such as age group or spending habits. 

Creating and Importing Campaign Targets
A target is an individual that you have some information on but does not qualify as a 
lead or contact. Targets are stand-alone records that are not attached to contacts, leads, 
or opportunities. However, you can add contacts, leads, and users to a campaign’s 
target list. 

You can add targets to a target list by importing them from a file (either CSV or TSV) 
or by selecting them from existing contacts and leads. For information on importing 
targets, see “Importing Data” on page 111.

Usually, you create or import a target list first, associate it with targets, and then 
associate it with a campaign. However, you can also create a campaign first and then 
associate it with a target list. 

The general process is as follows:

A target list can specify either individuals who need to be included in a campaign or 
excluded from a campaign. You can create one of the following types of target lists:

Default. A list of people who are the campaign targets and receive the campaign

email.



Campaigns Module
Seed. A list of people who need to receive the campaign email but must not be 
tracked as potential leads. Typically, these are individuals who need to approve 
the campaign before it is launched.
Test. A list of people who receive the campaign email to test it before it is sent out 
to the default list. 
Suppression List: A list of people you want excluded from the campaign email 
recipient list. Typically, these are people who chose to opt out of receiving your 
campaign message. Suppression lists can be by ID, email address, or domain.

Note: Test and seed lists are ignored in email tracking statistics. 

If you have purchased a license for the Sugar Plug-in for Microsoft Word, you can 
create a form letter in Word for your targets and perform a mail-merge to customize 
the letter for each target. For more information on Word plug-in, see Sugar Plug-in for 
Microsoft Word. For more information on performing a mail merge, see “Performing 
a Mail Merge” on page 94.

Types of Campaigns

You can create the many types of marketing campaigns such as Email, Newsletter, 
Mail, Web, Radio, Television, Print, and Telesales. 

When you create a campaign such as Mail and Radio, you are creating a record in 
Sugar Suite for your reference. But, you cannot execute the campaign through Sugar 
Suite. 
79



Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
You can execute an Email campaign or a Newsletter campaign through Sugar Suite. 
An email campaign is sent to the targets’ email addresses. A newsletter campaign is an 
email campaign that you send out in the form of a newsletter to your targets on a 
regular basis. You can send out a newsletter on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly 
basis. To measure the campaign’s success, you can view statistics such as the number 
of targets that responded, the number of opportunities that were created, and the 
generated revenue. 

After you launch an Email or Newsletter campaign, you can view its status to 
determine its success. For example, you can view how many targets viewed the 
campaign email, how many clicked any links that were included in the email, and how 
many leads and contacts were created from the campaign. For more information, see 
“Managing Campaigns” on page 88.

To capture leads from an email or a newsletter campaign, you can create a Web-to-
Lead form. For more information, see “Creating Web-to-Lead Forms” on page 92.

For Email campaigns, you can embed images in your email templates instead of 
sending them as attachments. This prevents your emails from being reported as spam. 
For more information on embedding images, see “Creating Email Templates” on 
page 73.

A campaign diagnostic tool is provided to help you ensure that all pending 
administrative tasks, such as setting up a bounce-handling inbox, have been 
completed. For more information, see “Using the Campaign Wizard” on page 85.

Note: You must be an administrator to use the Email Setup option that displays in 
the Shortcuts menu.

Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
3. Create an email template containing the message you want to convey to your 
targets. For more information, see “Creating Email Templates” on page 73. 

4. Specify an inbox for bounce-handling. This is required to handle campaign emails 
that bounce back to you. Only administrators can set up mailboxes for inbound 
emails. When you create a bounce-handling inbox, all bounced campaign emails 
are routed to that inbox. Bounced emails contain specific identifiers that enable 
you to tell them apart from emails that are responses from your targets. 
For more information on creating a mailbox, see the Sugar Enterprise and 
Professional Administration Guide.

5. Create an email marketing record that specifies information such as the target list, 
the email template, the campaign start date, and the bounce-handling inbox. For 
more information, see “Creating Email Marketing Records” on page 82.

6. Optionally, specify one or more Tracker Redirect URLs to track campaign 
activities. For more information, see “To create a tracker redirect URL” on 
page 84.

7. Optionally, run the diagnostic tool to ensure that the email campaign will be 
successfully executed. For more information, see “To run diagnostics” on 
page 88.

8. Send a test email to your test list to ensure the operation is successful. For more 
information on test lists, see “Creating and Importing Campaign Targets” on 
page 76.

9. Clear statistics from the test email.
10. Request the administrator to schedule a job to send out the campaign emails.
11. Queue the email for the campaign launch.
12. Optionally, convert the campaign targets into leads or contacts.

You can associate a Web-to-Lead form with the campaign. For more information, see 
“Creating Web-to-Lead Forms” on page 92.

After you launch an email campaign, you can view the campaign status for 
information on the campaign results. For more information, see “Viewing Campaign 
Status” on page 89.

Note: The start date, start time, and status specified on the email marketing page 
determine when the email is sent.

Creating Email Marketing Records

When you create an email campaign, you must also create an email marketing record 
that contains information such as the campaign target list, the campaign email 
template, and the inbox to handle emails that bounce back to you. You must specify 
the email marketing start date and time that is in the past to queue it for delivery. Any 
emails that bounce back are sent to the From address defined in this record.

Creating Tracker Redirect URLs

A campaign email can contain not only the campaign message but also images and 
links. Links can direct targets to other URLs such as an external Web site or a .php file 
83

on your system. 



Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
You can use one or more tracker URLs in your campaign emails to track the response 
to your campaign. The system generates a unique key for each URL and for each 
recipient and associates it with the email template. When recipients open the email 
and click on a URL link, the system, using the unique key identifier, track each action 
by each recipient. 

You can also provide a link to allow targets to unsubscribe themselves from your 
campaign mailing list. You can embed an “Unsubscribe” link in a tracker URL. When 
targets click on this URL to unsubscribe from your campaign emails, the system logs 
the action for your records.

Note: Before you create a campaign email, check with your system administrator to 
ensure that the outbound email process is configured to send email from your 
system as described in Configure System section and Mass Emailing section.

To create a tracker redirect URL
1. On the Campaign’s detail page, scroll down to the Tracker URLs sub-panel, and 

click Create.

2. On the Campaign Trackers page, enter information for the following fields:
Tracker Name. Enter a tracker name for your reference; use alpha-numeric 
characters.
Tracker URL. Enter the tracker URL; for example, http://www.sugarcrm.com.
Opt-out Link? Select this box to embed your “Unsubscribe” instructions in a 
tracker URL. By default, the system uses the removeme.php file which contains 
these instructions, and displays this file name in the Tracker URL field.

3. To create the campaign tracker, click Save; click Cancel to exit the page without 
saving your changes.

You can now insert this tracker URL into an email template of your choice. For more 
information, see “Creating Email Templates” on page 73.

Chapter 3 Using Sugar Suite
Employees Module
Use the Employees module to view information such as name, title, and email address 
for employees in your organization.

Users who are not administrators can view employee information, contact employees, 
and export employee information to their local machine. However, they cannot create 
or manage employee information.

While all users are employees, not all employees are users. To be a user, an employee 
needs a username and password to log into Sugar Suite. As an administrator, you can 
convert an employee into a user and specify the username and password for the 
employee. You can also edit employee details such as home address, email address, 
and phone number.

To create an employee
1. Log into Sugar Suite as an administrator.
2. Click the Employees option located at the top right-hand corner of the page.
3. In the Shortcuts menu of the Employees Home page, click Create Employee.

Import and Export

This chapter discusses how to import data into Sugar Suite and how to export data 
from Sugar Suite to your local machine. 

Topics include:
z “Importing Data” on page 111
z “Exporting Data” on page 116

Importing Data
You can import data from Excel files, CRM systems, and Contact Managers into 
Sugar Suite. When you import data, you will need to map fields that you are importing 
with fields that exist in the Sugar database. For example, to map the first and last 
names of contacts that you import into sugar, these fields must exist in the Sugar 
database. If not, you will need to create these custom fields in Sugar Suite before you 
import the data.

You can import the following:
z Accounts: Salesforce.com, ACT!2005, custom comma delimited files, and custom 

tab delimited files.
z Contacts: Salesforce.com, Microsoft Outlook, ACT!2005, custom comma 

delimited files, and custom tab delimited files.
z Leads: Salesforce.com, comma delimited files, custom delimited files, and 

custom tab delimited files.
111Sugar Open Source User Guide

z Notes: Salesforce.com, comma delimited files, tab delimited files, and custom tab 
delimited files.

To import data from your previous CRM application or Contact Manager, you must 
first export the data from that application in a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file 



Chapter 4 Import and Export
format to your local file system. You can then use the import function within a specific 
module to import the CSV file data into Sugar Suite.

Accounts and Contacts. If you import a contact record that refers to an unknown 
account, then a new contact record is automatically created for an account of that 
name. Note that when account records are created automatically in this fashion, they 
are empty. That is, they have associated contacts but no address or telephone 
information. Therefore, you will need to manually add those details later. To avoid this 
task, it is recommended that you import the account data first to create complete 
records with address and telephone information (and other information depending on 
your previous CRM system) and then import contact data. 

If you are importing account data from another CRM system, then, typically, that 
system understands the distinction between a contact and an account – that one 
account can have multiple contacts – and has separate data for each. However, you can 
only import contact data from a simpler Contact Manager application– such as 
Microsoft Outlook.

Leads and Opportunities. Typically, only full CRM system, such as Salesforce.com 
track leads and opportunities. 

Targets. Targets, used in marketing campaigns, are stand-alone records that are not 
attached to contacts or leads. However, you can include contact, lead, and user records 
in a target list.

Notes. You can import notes related to a specific call, meeting, or task for 
distribution to participants. 

To export contacts from your current contact manager

The process below describes exporting contact information through Outlook 2003. 
Other systems tend to work in similar ways.
1. Under the File menu, select Import and Export. 

The Import and Export Wizard dialog box displays. 
2. Select Export to a file and click Next.
3. Select the option to create a file of the type Comma Separated Values (Windows), 

and click Next.
4. Select an Outlook folder from which to export – typically your contacts folder - 

and click Next.
5. Enter the filename and directory location for the exported file to be created, and 

click Next.
6. To confirm your intention to export this file, click Finish. 

Outlook 2003 creates a CSV file. To ensure that the data has been exported 
successfully, you can view the file using Microsoft Excel or a text editor.

Now you can import the contact data as described in “To import data” on page 113.
112 Sugar Open Source User Guide



Importing Data
During import, ensure that you correctly map the names of the incoming fields with 
the names of the corresponding Sugar Suite fields. If you are importing from Outlook, 
a particularly important field mapping is the incoming Company field to the Account 
Name field within Sugar Suite. This is required to ensure that contacts are associated 
with the correct accounts. 

To import data
1. In the Shortcuts menu of the module’s home page, click Import.

The first step in the import process displays.

2. Select one of the following as the data source:
Salesforce.com. Select this option if the data file is located in the Salesforce.com 
database. 
Microsoft Outlook. This option is available only for Sugar modules that are 
mapped to a corresponding module in Outlook. Select this option if the data file is 
located in Microsoft Outlook.
Act!2005. This option is available only for Sugar modules that are mapped to a 
corresponding module in ACT. Select this option if the data file is located in the 
Act! 2005 database.
Comma Delimited File. Select this option if the data file is in .csv format. 
Tab Delimited File. Select this option if the data file is in a tab delimited format.
Custom Delimited File. Select this option if the data file is in TSV format. 

3. Click Next to proceed to the next step in the import process.
You must now upload the file that you saved on your local file system.

4. In the Select file field, enter the path to the file location; or click Browse to 
navigate to the file location on your machine.

5. If the file has a header row, check the Has Header box. 
113Sugar Open Source User Guide



Chapter 4 Import and Export
Typically, a header row contains column titles such as Name and Address.
6. Click Next to proceed to the final step in the import process.

You must now map the fields from the export file to the fields in the Sugar Suite 
database to successfully import the data.

7. From the Database Field drop-down list, select the appropriate field in the note, 
such as Full Name and map it to the row in the imported source file. If you want to 
ignore a field, select Do not map this field.

8. To save the mapping as a custom mapping that you can use repeatedly, select the 
Save as Custom Mapping checkbox.

9. To check indexes for duplicate values for fields such as Deleted, and Assigned 
users, move the desired indexes from the Index(es) Not Used column to the 
Index(es) Used column using the left arrow button. 
To remove an index that you do not want to check, use the right arrow to move it 
back to the Index(es) Not Used column. Use the up and down arrows to sort the 
order in which the indexes are checked for duplicates.

10. Click Import Now to import the data.
The Import Results page lists the imported data and lists how many fields were 
successfully imported and how many were skipped.
114 Sugar Open Source User Guide



Importing Data
11. To import additional data, click Import More.
12. To end the task, click Finished.
13. If you do not want to save the imported data, click Undo Last Import; You can 

click Try Again to restart the import process.

To import account data

If you are importing account data from a CRM system, proceed to step 4. If you 
exported contact data, and need to massage it to act as account data to be imported, 
perform steps 1-4 below:
1. Copy your exported contacts.csv file and save it as Accounts.csv.
2. Edit the Accounts.csv file using Excel. First, sort the file on the column which 

contains the company name. 
As you scroll through your data, sorted by company name, you may see 
successive records which have the same company name if there is more than one 
contact from that account (in Sugar Suite terminology). To avoid multiple copies 
of the same account within Sugar Suite, you need to delete the duplicate contacts. 
And to make sure that the most complete information is attached to the account 
record, retain only the contact whose address and telephone information best 
represents the account as a whole. 
Also look out for company names which are similar but not identical due to 
inconsistencies in the way the company name was entered – you should delete all 
duplicate records except the one with the company name spelt exactly how you 
want to see it in Sugar Suite.

3. Save the Excel file as a .csv file type.
4. In the Shortcuts menu of the Accounts module, click Import and follow the 

process described in “To import data” on page 113.

Now that account data has been imported, you can export contacts from your current 
Contact Manager and then import it into Sugar Suite.

Chapter 4 Import and Export
Exporting Data
You can export Sugar Suite item records in .csv format to your local machine. You can 
use Microsoft Excel, Notepad, or other text editors to open .csv files. You can export 
selected records, all records on the page, or the entire list.

A sample portion of a CSV file, exported from the Accounts module and viewed in 
Excel, is shown in below. The CSV file displays column titles, including the Record 
ID (a long string of letters and numbers used as a unique reference to each account 
record) and other fields which Sugar Suite uses internally.

To export data from Sugar Suite
1. On the module’s home page, click the Export icon located above the item list.
2. Select from the following Export options:

Selected Records. To export one or more records on the list, select the records 
from the list, and select this option.
Current Page. To export all the records listed on the page, select this option.

Entire list. To export all records on the list (which could be more than a page long), 
select this option.

3. In the File Download dialog box, select Open to open the export file in .csv 
format.

4. Click Save to save it on your local machine; click Cancel to exit the dialog box 
without saving the file.
