SECTION 3 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE

3.1  IBM hereby grants to LICENSEE a non-exclusive, royalty-free, revocable (pursuant only
to the terms of Section 5), nontransferable, worldwide license under all copyrights, mask works,
trade secrets and know-how owned by IBM, associated with the CoreConnect Bus Structures, to
use, reproduce, display, distribute, and perform the CoreConnect Bus Structures and to make,
have made, use, sell, lease and/or otherwise transfer Licensee Product.  LICENSEE shall have no
right to grant  sublicenses under this Section 3.1 to any entity.

3.2   IBM hereby grants to LICENSEE a non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable, royalty-
free immunity from any charge or claim of infringement under the Licensed Patent Claims
resulting from LICENSEE making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing
and/or otherwise transferring Licensee Products, solely to the extent necessary to exercise its
license rights as set forth in Section 3.1.  No license, immunity or other right is granted under
this Section 3.2 by IBM either directly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise:



Agreement No.:___________

3.2.1 other than under the Licensed Patent Claims; or

3.2.2 with respect to any other product or item other than a Licensee Product, whether 
or not such other product or item is used in or in conjunction with a Licensee Product.

3.3 LICENSEE understands and agrees that no license, immunity or other right is granted
herein to LICENSEE, directly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, with respect to any
patents, proprietary information, know-how, mask works, copyrights or other intellectual
property rights, except as specifically provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 , and that no additional
licenses, immunity or other rights shall arise from the consummation of this Agreement or from
any acts, statements or dealing leading to such consummation.

3.4  The license and immunity granted by IBM to LICENSEE in Sections 3.1 and  3.2 do not
include the right of LICENSEE to modify the CoreConnect Bus Structures, other than for the
sole purpose of making the minimum changes necessary to perform Technology Mapping and
Manufacturing Test unless LICENSEE obtains IBM’s prior written approval to make additional
modifications.   LICENSEE hereby agrees to provide any modifications to IBM and hereby
grants to IBM a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, paid-up, irrevocable license to any such
modifications made by LICENSEE and adopted by IBM as part of the CoreConnect Bus
Structures, with the unrestricted right to grant sublicenses thereunder.

3.5   The immunity granted to LICENSEE in Section 3.2 shall automatically terminate if:

3.5.1  LICENSEE asserts a claim or action against IBM based on or related to a patent 
owned or licensable by LICENSEE; or

3.5.2  LICENSEE asserts a claim or action against an IBM CoreConnect licensee based 
on or related to a patent owned or licensable by LICENSEE and alleging infringement of 
such patent in the manufacture, use, sale or other transfer of CoreConnect Bus Structures.

3.6  LICENSEE agrees to reference the CoreConnect Bus Structures as the property of IBM
on its sales literature, advertising, presentation materials, press materials and exhibits for
Licensee Products.

3.7  None of the licenses granted by IBM to LICENSEE include any assurances as to non-
infringement of third party intellectual property, including (but not limited to) third party patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and mask works.  LICENSEE acknowledges that in order
for it to manufacture and sell Licensee Products, it may be necessary for LICENSEE to obtain
patent licenses from other parties, and the obtaining of such licenses shall be at LICENSEE’s
sole responsibility and shall be at LICENSEE’s sole expense.  Moreover, IBM makes no
representation as to the need for such licenses or their availability.



Agreement No.:___________
3.8       LICENSEE agrees to use the CoreConnect Test Generator to create a CoreConnect Test
Suite and to use its best efforts to ensure that any and all Licensee Products, including those
previously tested in LICENSEE’s testing protocol,  achieve CoreConnect Compliance prior to
any shipment of such Licensee Product(s).  The CoreConnect Test Suite must be run with the
PLB and OPB monitors attached to the CoreConnect Bus Structures.  If a Licensee Product fails
to achieve CoreConnect Compliance then LICENSEE shall not label or describe the failed
Licensee Product as being compliant with the CoreConnect Bus Structures.  Despite the exercise
of LICENSEE’s best efforts to ensure that a Licensee Product achieve CoreConnect Compliance,
if a Licensee Product inadvertently fails to achieve CoreConnect Compliance and business
conditions don’t allow for correction of the design of such failed Licensee Product, then
LICENSEE and/or LICENSEE’s customer may ship the Licensee Product (under the above
labeling restriction) but LICENSEE agrees to achieve CoreConnect Compliance on the next
design of the failed Licensee Product.  The Parties intend that shipment of Licensee Products
which fail to achieve CoreConnect Compliance shall be an infrequent occurrence and that abuse
by LICENSEE of the right to ship Licensee Products which fail to achieve CoreConnect
Compliance shall be cause for termination of this Agreement by IBM pursuant to Section 5.2.4.
If LICENSEE is experiencing a fundamental problem in achieving CoreConnect Compliance for
a Licensee Product, upon request by LICENSEE, IBM agrees to review LICENSEE’s design
implementation and permit a variance from CoreConnect Compliance where in IBM’s sole
discretion, such variance is appropriate.  If LICENSEE’s failure to achieve CoreConnect
Compliance for a Licensee Product results from errors in the CoreConnect Test Suite, then
LICENSEE may ship Licensee Products which failed to achieve CoreConnect Compliance
because of such errors and may designate them as being CoreConnect compliant.

3.9       At IBM’s expense, no more frequently than once every twelve month period, IBM,
through an independent technical auditor of IBM’s choice, acceptable to LICENSEE, shall have
the right to audit LICENSEE’s testing procedures for achieving CoreConnect Compliance for
Licensee Products.  The auditor shall deliver a report to IBM of the results of the audit.  If the
auditor finds that LICENSEE’s testing procedures are unacceptable when compared to industry
standards, then LICENSEE agrees to cure any defects uncovered by the audit within sixty (60)
days.  Failure to cure such defects shall be grounds for termination of this Agreement by IBM
pursuant to Section 5.2.4.

3.10 LICENSEE hereby grants to IBM the right to publicize in IBM’s sales literature,
advertising, presentation materials, press materials, exhibits and web pages, the fact that
LICENSEE has obtained the license rights to the CoreConnect Bus Structures granted herein.

SECTION  4 - CORECONNECT BUS USER’S GROUP

IBM may form a CoreConnect Bus User’s Group.  In the event IBM forms such a group,
LICENSEE hereby agrees to join the CoreConnect Bus User’s Group.  The CoreConnect Bus
User’s Group will,  inter alia, collect CoreConnect Bus performance feedback from licensees of
the CoreConnect Bus Structures and discuss improvements to the CoreConnect Bus Structures.
LICENSEE hereby  grants to IBM a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, paid-up, perpetual
and irrevocable license to any such improvements made by LICENSEE and adopted by IBM as



Agreement No.:___________
part of the CoreConnect Bus Structures, with the unrestricted right to grant sublicenses
thereunder.

SECTION 5 - TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1 The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date, and unless previously
terminated as hereinafter set forth, shall remain in force indefinitely.

5.2 IBM shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement, including the

LICENSEE, upon the happening of any of the following events:

5.2.1  A determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that makes it unlawful for
the Parties to continue the relationship contemplated by this Agreement;

5.2.2  If LICENSEE is in default of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement and such default is not cured or a cure plan acceptable to IBM is not
established, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice from IBM specifying
such default.

5.2.3  LICENSEE  ceases doing business, is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or files a
petition for bankruptcy.

5.2.4 LICENSEE repeatedly sells Licensee Products that fail to achieve CoreConnect
Compliance.

5.3 LICENSEE may terminate this Agreement without cause by giving thirty (30) days
written notice of termination to IBM.

5.4 Sections 2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, the license grant set forth in Section 4, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
and 11 shall survive and continue after any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

5.5   Promptly after termination of this Agreement, LICENSEE shall return to IBM any IBM
Confidential Information in LICENSEE’s possession.

5.6   The licenses granted herein to LICENSEE shall terminate upon any termination or
expiration of this Agreement and IBM agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cease
referring to LICENSEE as a licensee of the CoreConnect Bus Structures.
