Mary Nell and Ted,


As discussed, attached is an individual Master Log for: (a) ECTRIC, (b) EFET and (c) Enron Credit.  Each log was based on Houston’s Termination Log as of 2-11-02. 


In reviewing the respective Master Logs you will notice that:


the attached ECTRIC & EFET Master Logs include some of the same entries -- because the termination letter may have related to each; 

each of the attached Master Logs include some counterparties as represented on the London office report entitled “Schedule of Claims, as of the week commencing 2-4-02” – because in many cases the Enron entity was not included in such schedule; and  

 therefore, in accordance with the “Tab No.” reference used in London’s Schedule of Claims the following counterparties are included in one or more of the attached Master Logs:


Tab No.
