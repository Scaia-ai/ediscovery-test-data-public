Attn:  	Mr. John Special



Ladies and Gentlemen:


	New Dominion LLC (the "Disclosing Party") is prepared to furnish Enron North America Corp. ("Enron") with financial statement information in connection with potential transactions involving one or more physical or financially-settled energy or other commodity transactions between Disclosing Party and one or more of Enron’s affiliates (the "Transaction"), which financial statement information may be confidential or otherwise generally not available to the public (such financial statement information being hereinafter referred to as the "Confidential Information").  The term "Confidential Information" shall not include any such financial statement information (a) as is or may become generally available to the public other than by disclosure from Enron or its Representatives in violation of this agreement, (b) is known to Enron at the time of disclosure or is thereafter acquired from a source other than the Disclosing Party that was not known to Enron or reasonably believed (upon inquiry) by Enron to be prohibited from making disclosure, or (c) is hereafter independently developed by Enron.


		As a condition to the Disclosing Party furnishing the Confidential Information to Enron and Enron agreeing to receive the Confidential Information, Enron and the Disclosing Party agree as follows:


1.	Enron will not disclose the Confidential Information furnished to it pursuant to this agreement without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, other than to Enron's directors, officers, and employees, as well as those individual representatives, lenders, counsel and affiliates, and each of their respective individual directors, officers, employees, representatives, lenders, counsel, and affiliates, if any, to whom Enron discloses such Confidential Information for purposes of evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the proposed Transaction (those individuals who are directly or indirectly furnished Confidential Information by Enron are collectively referred to herein as the "Representatives").  Enron may also disclose the Confidential Information in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation or ruling.  Except as otherwise provided herein, Enron will not use the Confidential Information other than for the evaluation, negotiation and consummation of the proposed Transaction.


2.	The Confidential Information that is written, except for that which may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for Enron, will be returned to the Disclosing Party immediately upon the Disclosing Party's request and no copies shall be retained by Enron or the Representatives.  That portion of the Confidential Information that is found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for Enron which is not returned to the Disclosing Party will be held by Enron or the Representatives and kept subject to the terms of this agreement, or destroyed.


3.	Enron understands that the Disclosing Party will endeavor to include in the information Enron is furnished materials that the Disclosing Party believes to be reliable and relevant for the purpose of Enron's evaluation, and the Disclosing Party does not make any other representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information that is so provided. 


4.	Disclosing Party and Enron agree that no employment, agency, joint venture, partnership, or fiduciary relationship shall be deemed to exist or arise between them with respect to this agreement or the proposed Transaction.


5.	Disclosing Party shall have the right to apply to a court to enjoin any breach of this agreement.  Excepting the right of the Disclosing Party to seek such relief, all claims and matters in question arising out of this agreement or the relationship between the parties created by this agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  There shall be three arbitrators.  Each party shall designate an arbitrator, who need not be neutral, within 30 days of receiving notification of the filing with the AAA of a demand for arbitration.  The two arbitrators so designated shall elect a third arbitrator.  If either party fails to designate an arbitrator within the time specified or the two parties' arbitrators fail to designate a third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointments, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. It is expressly agreed that the arbitrators shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, the parties hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover punitive or exemplary damages, either in arbitration or in litigation.

	

6.	THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.


7.	The provisions of this Agreement shall terminate on the date one year from the date of this agreement.


								Very truly yours,


ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP.
