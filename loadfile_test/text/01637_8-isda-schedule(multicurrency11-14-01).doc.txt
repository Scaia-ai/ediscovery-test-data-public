(g)	For purposes of any Transaction in which paper or pulp is the relevant Commodity, the phrase “within 30 calendar days” in line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the phrase “within 40 calendar days.”

(h)	For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant Commodity is traded in a market that is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; (ii) it may be more difficult for it to obtain quotations from a marketmaker or other dealer that is not a party to the Transaction and consequently to establish an independent value for the Transaction; (iii) any prices or terms quoted by Party A for entering into, modifying, or terminating a Transaction, although based upon what Party A believes to be a commercially reasonable valuation methodology, may be different than if this market were more mature and liquid; and (iv) any valuations which may be provided by Party A do not necessarily reflect Party A’s internal bookkeeping or theoretical model-based valuations of the Transaction and may reflect other factors, including without limitation the creditworthiness of a counterparty, costs of carry, use of capital, and profit.


�[Part 7.  Additional Terms for FX Transactions and Currency Option Transactions.

(a)	Standard Terms and Conditions Applicable to FX Transactions and Currency Option Transactions.  Each FX Transaction or Currency Option Transaction outstanding at or entered into after the date hereof between the parties shall be expressly governed by this Agreement irrespective of any references in a Confirmation or otherwise to any other master agreements (e.g. FEOMA, IFEMA, ICOM, any specified terms and conditions).  In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the FX Definitions, this Agreement will prevail.


Where an FX Transaction or Currency Option is confirmed by means of exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system or other document or other confirming evidence exchanged between the parties confirming such Transaction such messages, document or evidence will constitute a "Confirmation" for the purposes of this Agreement even where not so specified therein.

(b)	Incorporation of and Amendments to ISDA FX Definitions.  The 1998 ISDA FX and Currency Option Definitions (the "FX and Currency Option Definitions"), published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. are hereby incorporated by reference with respect to any "FX Transaction" and "Currency Option Transaction" as defined by the FX and Currency Option Definitions, except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in a Confirmation.


The following amendment is made to the FX and Currency Option Definitions:


Section 3 of the FX and Currency Option Definitions is hereby amended by the addition of the following as a new Section 3.4(c):


"Section 3.4(c).  Terms Relating to Payment of Premium.

(i)	Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the Premium related to a Currency Option Transaction shall be paid on its Premium Payment Date in immediately available funds.


(ii)	If a Premium is not received on the Premium Payment Date, the Seller may elect:  (1) to accept a late payment of such Premium; (2) to give written notice of such non-payment and, if such payment shall not be received within two Local Business Days of such notice, treat the related Currency Option Transaction as void; or (3) to give written notice of such non-payment and, if such payment shall not be received within two Local Business Days of such notice, treat such non-payment as an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i).  If the Seller elects to act under clause (1) of the preceding sentence, the Buyer shall pay interest on such Premium in the same currency as such Premium from the day such Premium was due until the day paid at the Default Rate, as determined in good faith by the Seller; if the Seller elects to act under clause (2) of the preceding sentence, the Buyer shall pay all out-of-pocket costs and actual damages incurred in connection with such unpaid or late Premium or void Currency Option Transaction, including without limitation, interest on such Premium in the same currency as such Premium at the then prevailing market rate and any other costs or expenses incurred by the Seller in covering its obligations (including, without limitation, a delta hedge) with respect to such Currency Option Transaction."


	(c)	Discharge and Termination of Currency Option Transactions.  Unless otherwise agreed, any Call Option or any Put Option written by a party will automatically be terminated and discharged, in whole or in part, as applicable, against a Call Option or a Put Option, respectively, written by the other party, such termination and discharge to occur automatically upon the payment in full of the last Premium payable in respect of such Currency Option Transactions; provided that, such termination and discharge may only occur in respect of Currency Option Transactions:


(i)	each being with respect to the same Put Currency and the same Call Currency;

(ii)	each having the same Expiration Date and Expiration Time;

(iii)	each being of the same style, i.e. either both being American Style Options or both being European Style Options;

(iv)	each having the same Strike Price; and

(v)	neither of which shall have been exercised by delivery of a Notice of Exercise;


and, upon the occurrence of such termination and discharge, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other party in respect of the relevant Currency Option Transactions or, as the case may be, parts thereof so terminated and discharged.  In the case of a partial termination and discharge (i.e. where the relevant Currency Options are for different amounts of the Currency Pair), the remaining portion of the Currency Option which is partially discharged and terminated shall continue to be a Currency Option Transaction for all purposes of this Agreement.]
�[Part 8.  Transactions Governed by FRABBA Terms.

Any forward rate agreement into which the parties have entered and in respect of which the confirmation or other confirming evidence refers to or incorporates the British Bankers' Association London Interbank Forward Rate Agreements Recommended Terms and Conditions (1985 edition) ("FRABBA Terms") will be governed by this Agreement.  Any forward rate agreement into which the parties may enter and in respect of which the confirmation or other confirming evidence refers to or incorporates the FRABBA Terms will be governed by this Agreement in all circumstances except when the parties expressly agree otherwise.  Each such transaction will be deemed to be a Transaction and each such confirmation or other confirming evidence will be deemed to constitute a Confirmation for purposes of this Agreement.  Sections B, C and E and clauses, 1, 4, 5 and 6 of Section D of the FRABBA Terms are hereby incorporated by reference in this Agreement.  Those Sections are applicable only to transactions to which this provision relates and will prevail in the event of any inconsistency with any other provision of this Agreement.  In the event of any other inconsistency between the FRABBA Terms and this Agreement, this Agreement will govern.  Clauses 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of Section D of the FRABBA Terms are not applicable to any transaction to which this provision relates.]

LEGAL OPINION

 

[Letterhead of Counterparty’s Outside Legal Counsel]



[Date]


Enron North America Corp.

1400 Smith Street

Houston, Texas 77002


Sir/Madame


I have acted as counsel to [Party B], a [ 		] (“Party B”), and I am familiar with matters pertaining to the execution and delivery of (i) the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of ___________, 200_ between [Party A] (“Party A”) and Party B (ii), the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of ___________, 200_, (iii) the ISDA Credit Support Annex thereto dated as of _______, 200_ (collectively referred to herein as the “Agreement”), all of them between Party B and Party A. The Agreement is to be supplemented by confirmations of Transactions to be entered into by Party A and Party B from time to time (each a “Confirmation”), and the Agreement, together with all such Confirmations, shall constitute one agreement.


Terms defined in the Agreement are used herein as therein defined, unless otherwise defined herein.


In connection with this opinion, I have examined: 

	

1.	Party B’s by-laws and all amendments thereto (the “By-laws”).


2.	Resolutions of the Board of Directors of Party B passed on _______, 200_ authorizing and approving the Transactions; and


3.	All such other documents, laws and instruments I have deemed necessary for the issuance of this opinion, including the Agreement, executed by each party thereto.


I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined such other documents, records, agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant for the purposes of this opinion.


In this opinion, I have assumed the authenticity of all the signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies.


Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:


1.	Party B is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation.


2.	Party B has the corporate power to execute and deliver the Agreement and other documents that it is required to deliver in connection therewith and to perform its obligations under the Agreement and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution and delivery and the performance of those obligations.


3.	Party B’s execution and delivery of the Agreement and the other documentation relating to the Agreement that it is required to deliver in connection therewith and its performance of its obligations under the Agreement do not violate or conflict with any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, any provision of its charter or By-laws (or comparable constituent documents), any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting Party B or any of its assets.


4.	All authorizations of and exemptions, actions or approvals by, and all notices to or filings with, any governmental or other authority that are required to have been obtained or made by Party B with respect to the Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated in the Agreement have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, and all conditions of any such authorizations, exemptions, actions or approvals have been complied with.


5.	The Agreement constitutes Party B’s legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against Party B in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of law.


6.	The Agreement is not subject to any stamp or documentary tax or other similar charge (other than a court tax (“tasa de justicia”), which at the time of the delivery of this opinion is of up to 3% of the amount claimed, with respect to the institution of any judicial proceedings to enforce the Agreement in the City of Buenos Aires or the federal courts of Argentina) imposed by Argentina or any governmental agency, political, subdivision or taxing authority thereof.


7.	It is not necessary or advisable, in order to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the Agreement in any enforcement proceedings which may be instituted in Argentina, that the Agreement or any instruments related thereto, be filed, recorded or registered with any governmental agency or notarized by a notary public or that any stamp, registration or similar transaction tax or duty be paid; provided, however, that in connection with enforcement proceedings brought in the City of Buenos Aires or the federal courts of Argentina a court tax (“tasa de justicia”) of up to 3% must be paid as referred to in Paragraph 6 above; and provided, further, that in the event any legal proceedings are brought in the courts of Argentina, an official Spanish translation or any document in any language other than Spanish required in such proceedings shall be necessary.


8.	A final judgment against Party B for the payment of monies obtained in any court would be recognized, conclusive and enforceable in the federal courts of Argentina or the courts of the City of Buenos Aires without reconsideration on the merits as provided in Articles 517 through 519 of the National Code of Civil and Commercial Procedures or Argentina (the “CPCC”); provided that the requirements of Article 517 are met, as follows: (i) the judgment, which must be final in the jurisdiction where rendered, was issued by a court competent in accordance with the Argentine principles regarding international jurisdiction (and the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in the City and State of New York are, by virtue of the submission of Party B to the jurisdiction of such courts, competent courts in accordance with such principles) and resulted from a personal action,  or an in rem action with respect to personal property if such was transferred to Argentine territory during or after the prosecution of the foreign action; (ii) the defendant against whom enforcement of the judgment is sought was personally served with the summons and, in accordance with due process of law, was given an opportunity to defend against the foreign action; (iii) the judgment must be valid in the jurisdiction where rendered and its authenticity must be established in accordance with the requirements of Argentine law; (iv) the judgment does not violate the principles of public policy or Argentine law; and (v) the judgment is not contrary to a prior or simultaneous judgment of an Argentine court. In my view, no principle of public policy is violated by any provision of the Agreement�. Service of process effected in the manner set forth in Section 13(c) of the Agreement and Part [ ( )]� of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement will be effective, insofar as Argentine law is concerned, to confer personal jurisdiction over Party B. The irrevocable waiver by Party B of its right to demand that Party A post a bond or guaranty (“cautio jiudicatum solvi”) in any proceedings initiated against Party B in the courts of Argentina is valid, binding and enforceable against Party B.


9.	The provisions of Section 2(d) of the Agreement providing for Deduction or Withholding for Tax, to the effect, inter alia, that Party B shall pay such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Party A (free and clear of any Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against Party A or B) will equal the full amount Party A would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required subject to the restrictions established therein, are valid, binding and enforceable under Argentine law.


10.	The provisions in the Agreement as to the:


	(a) choice of the laws of the State of New York to be the law governing the Agreement;


	(b) submission of Party B to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America located in the City and State of New York in any action under the Agreement or any instrument related thereto; and


	(c) appointment by Party B of an agent for the service of process in New York, New York, United States of America;


	(d) waiver of sovereign immunity provided in the Agreement.�

are legal, valid, binding and enforceable under Argentine law, provided that, with respect to service of process (including service of process upon any process agent outside Argentina), the provisions of Article 517(2) of the CPCC are complied with, which require that the defendant against whom enforcement of the judgment is sought was personally served with the summons and, in accordance with due process of law, was given an opportunity to defend against the foreign action.


11.	It is not necessary under the laws of Argentina in order to enable the parties to the Agreement to enforce their rights under the Agreement that such parties to the Agreement should be licensed, qualified or entitled to carry on business in Argentina by reason of the execution, delivery or performance of the Agreement or any Transaction.


12.	Party A will not be deemed to be a resident, domiciled, carrying on business or subject to taxation (other than as specified above) in Argentina by reason only of the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Agreement or any instrument related thereto.


13.	There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge after due investigation, threatened litigation, action or proceeding affecting Party B or any of its properties before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, (i) which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the financial condition of Party B, or (ii) which purports to affect the legality, validity enforceability or performance of the Agreement or any Transactions to be subscribed by Party B.


14.	Under the law of Argentina, neither Party B nor any of its property has any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from set off, from jurisdiction of any court of Argentina or any legal process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise).�

The opinions expressed herein are limited to questions arising under the laws of Argentina as in force on the date hereof. We do not purport to express any opinion on any matters arising under the laws of the United States or the laws of the State of New York or the laws of any other jurisdiction and do not express or imply any opinion on such laws.

Houston, Texas  77002

Re:	Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. (“Enron”) and [Name of Entity] (“Counterparty”)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are attorneys admitted to practice law in the [State][Country] of _______________ (the “Relevant Jurisdiction”), and we are generally familiar with the affairs of Counterparty.  We have examined and are familiar with (i) the documents relating to the creation, authorization, organization, existence, and operation of Counterparty, (ii) the ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of _______________, by and between Counterparty and Enron (together with the Schedule thereto, any other documents incorporated by reference therein or made a part thereof, [and any Credit Support Document to which Counterparty is a party,]� collectively, the “Swap Agreement”), (iii) the Confirmation, dated _________________, by and between Counterparty and Enron (the “Confirmation”) (the Swap Agreement and the Confirmation, collectively, the “Agreement”), (iv) all necessary documentation of Counterparty relating to its authorization, execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party, and (v) such other records, documents, and instruments as we deemed advisable.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1.	Counterparty is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the constitution and laws of the Relevant Jurisdiction.

2.	Counterparty has the legal right and power, pursuant to [Name and General Citation of Relevant Act or Statutes] (the “Act”), to execute the Agreement and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver the Agreement and any other documentation relating to the Agreement that it is required by the Agreement to deliver, and to perform its obligations under the Agreement and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party.  All necessary action and all necessary determinations and findings to authorize Counterparty’s execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement, and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party or that it is required by the Agreement to deliver, have been taken and made.  The individual(s) executing and delivering the Agreement, and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which Counterparty is a party or that it is required under the Agreement to deliver, are duly empowered and authorized to do so.  Counterparty has duly authorized, executed, and delivered the Agreement, and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party or that it is required under the Agreement to deliver.

3.	Such execution, delivery, and performance do not violate, conflict with, or constitute a breach or default under, any law applicable to Counterparty, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets, or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets.  Counterparty is not in violation or breach of, or default under, any law applicable to Counterparty, any provision of its constitutional documents, or any order or judgment of any court or agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets, which could adversely affect (i) the Agreement or any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party or that it is required by the Agreement to deliver, (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect, or enforceability thereof, (iii) the ability of Counterparty to perform its obligations thereunder, or (iv) the financial condition or operations of Counterparty.

4.	All governmental and other consents, approvals, registrations, licenses, or exemptions that are required to have been obtained by Counterparty with respect to the Agreement, or any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party or that it is required by the Agreement to deliver, have been obtained and are in full force and effect, and all conditions thereof have been complied with.

5.	[The obligations of Counterparty under the Agreement, and any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party, constitute its legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable against Counterparty in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).]�
6.	There is not pending or, to our knowledge, threatened against Counterparty (nor to our knowledge is there any basis for), any action, suit, claim, inquiry, investigation, or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency, official, or arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity, or enforceability against Counterparty of the Agreement, or any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party, or Counterparty’s ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement or any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party.

7.	Counterparty is an “eligible swap participant” as defined in the Part 35 Regulations of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

8.	Counterparty is not entitled to claim immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds with respect to itself or its revenues or assets (irrespective of their use or intended use) from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance, or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment), or (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its revenues or assets might otherwise be made subject to in any suit, action, or proceedings relating to the Agreement in the courts of any jurisdiction, and no such immunity (whether or not claimed) may be attributed to Counterparty or its revenues or assets.

9.	The Agreement and each Transaction thereunder do not constitute any kind of investment by Counterparty that is proscribed by any constitution, charter, law, rule, regulation, investment guideline or restriction, policy, government code, constituent or governing instrument, resolution, ordinance, order, writ, judgment, decree, or ruling to which Counterparty (or any of its officials in his or her respective capacity as such) or its property or revenues is subject.

10.	No person, firm, corporation, entity, or association other than Counterparty may liquidate, borrow, encumber, or otherwise utilize the assets [(including, without limitation, the assets identified in [[track language regarding assets of Party B in Schedule)] of Counterparty.

11.	The execution and delivery by Counterparty of the Agreement, any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which it is a party, and each Confirmation, and the performance by Counterparty of its obligations thereunder, are in furtherance, and not in violation, of the public purposes for which Counterparty was created and organized under the Act and pursuant to the laws of the Relevant Jurisdiction.

12.	The obligations of Counterparty to make payments to Enron under the Agreement and each Transaction (i) are not subject to appropriation or similar action, and (ii) do not (A) constitute any kind of indebtedness of Counterparty or (B) create any kind of lien on or security interest in any property or revenues of Counterparty which, in either case (A) or (B), is proscribed by any constitution, charter, law, rule, regulation, investment guideline or restriction, policy, government code, constituent or governing instrument, resolution, ordinance, order, writ, judgment, decree, or ruling to which Counterparty (or any of its officials in his or her respective capacity as such) or its property or revenues is subject.

13.	Counterparty’s obligations under the Agreement are, and until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof shall remain, [track language regarding source of payments in Schedule].

14.	The execution and delivery of the Agreement, or any of the documentation relating to the Agreement, will not result in the imposition of any tax, duty, or fee on Enron by any governmental or public board, body, agency, or other authority or instrumentality in the Relevant Jurisdiction.

15.	Enron is not (i) required to qualify or obtain any certificate of authority to do business in, or to register or file with, or to obtain any license from, any governmental or public board, body, agency, or other authority or instrumentality in the Relevant Jurisdiction, or (ii) subject to any requirement to make or pay any taxes, duties, or fees, required of foreign entities doing business in the Relevant Jurisdiction, in either case (i) or (ii), solely as a result of executing, delivering, and performing the Agreement, or any other documentation relating to the Agreement to which Enron is a party or that it is required by the Agreement to deliver.

Very truly yours,
