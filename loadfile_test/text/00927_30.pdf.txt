COUNTERCLAIMS OF DEFENDANT PAPERMASTER 

For his counterclaims against IBM, Mr. Papermaster alleges as follows: 

68. IBM’s form Noncompetition Agreement purports to restrict Mr. Papermaster for 

one (1) year following the termination of his employment with IBM from: (1) engaging or 

associating with any “Business Enterprise”; or (2) engaging or associating with “any significant 



  NY\1469151.5 
 

  

 

12

competitor or major competitor” of IBM.  (Noncompetition Agreement attached as Exhibit A to 

IBM’s Complaint, § 1(b).)  “Business Enterprise” is defined as “any entity that engages in, or 

owns or controls a significant interest in any entity that engages in, competition with the business 

units or divisions of the Company in which [Mr. Papermaster] worked during the two (2) year 

period prior to the termination of [his] employment.”  (Id., § 2(a).)  These restrictions purport to 

apply to companies within the “Restricted Area,” defined as “any geographic area in the world 

for which [Mr. Papermaster] had job responsibilities during the last twelve (12) months of [his] 

employment with the Company.”  (Id., § 2(d).) 

69. The business unit in which Mr. Papermaster was employed for the last two years 

was the Systems and Technology Group, in which he was the Vice President of Blade 

Development.        

70. Mr. Papermaster has been offered a job at Apple as Senior Vice President, 

Devices Hardware Engineering.  In this role, he will be in charge of product development for the 

iPod and the iPhone.         

71. Apple and IBM are not significant or major competitors.  IBM primarily provides 

business enterprise services, while Apple’s primary business is the design, manufacturing and 

marketing of consumer electronic products.     

72. The “Business Enterprise” restriction is unreasonably broad in that it purports to 

restrict Mr. Papermaster from going to work for any company that engages in competition with 

his former business unit to any extent, even if Mr. Papermaster will not be working for the part 

of the company that does so.  Likewise, the “significant competitor or major competitor” prong 

purports to restrict Mr. Papermaster from going to work for one of these companies even if the 

work that Mr. Papermaster will be doing is completely unrelated to the work he was doing at 



  NY\1469151.5 
 

  

 

13

IBM.  These provisions are not necessary to protect any legitimate interests of IBM.   

73. The Noncompetition Agreement is also unreasonably broad in that it purports to 

impose an unreasonably lengthy time limitation.  In the world of technology, any trade secrets 

that Mr. Papermaster possesses would lose their value prior to the expiration of a year.  The 

purported geographic scope of the “Restricted Area” is similarly unreasonable.  Mr. Papermaster 

has resided and worked in Austin, Texas for the past 17 years, yet the language of the 

Noncompetition Agreement purports to restrict him from working anywhere in the world based 

on the global scope of IBM’s business.  Again, these restrictions are not necessary to protect any 

legitimate interests of IBM.              

74. The Noncompetition Agreement also provides that it is “governed by, and 

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.”  (Noncompetition Agreement 

attached as Exhibit A to IBM’s Complaint, § 13.)  This provision is unenforceable.  Mr. 

Papermaster has no substantial relationship to New York, in that he has resided and worked in 

Texas for the past 17 years, and he is going to work for Apple, which is a California corporation.  

Mr. Papermaster therefore has the most significant contacts with Texas and California.  Both 

states hold that such noncompetition agreements are unenforceable as a matter of public policy.  

Because this is a fundamental policy of states with a materially greater interest in this dispute 

than New York, Texas or California law must be applied. 

75. Mr. Papermaster has honored and intends to continue to honor his agreement not 

to disclose any confidential IBM information.  Indeed, when Mr. Papermaster accepted the offer 

at Apple, he signed an Intellectual Property Agreement in which he agreed not to disclose or 

bring onto Apple property any “confidential, or proprietary, or secret information” of IBM.   

         



  NY\1469151.5 
 

  

 

14

COUNT 1 – DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT IBM’S FORM NONCOMPETITION 
AGREEMENT IS UNENFORCEABLY OVERBROAD 

 
76. Mr. Papermaster repeats and realleges as though fully set forth herein the 

allegations of Paragraphs 68 through 75 as Paragraph 76 of Count 1 above. 

77. The Noncompetition Agreement purports to restrict Mr. Papermaster for one year 

from going to work for any company in any capacity anywhere in the world that is either (1) a 

“significant competitor or major competitor” of IBM or (2) engages in competition with Mr. 

Papermaster’s former business unit at IBM to any extent.   

78. These provisions are unrestrained by any limitations keyed to uniqueness, trade 

secrets, confidentiality or competitive unfairness, and are not necessary to protect any legitimate 

interests of IBM.    

79. Here, Mr. Papermaster’s role at Apple will not require him to use any confidential 

information he may have acquired in his role at IBM.    

80. Mr. Papermaster is entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Noncompetition 

Agreement is unreasonably overbroad and unenforceable.   

COUNT 2 – DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT TEXAS OR CALIFORNIA LAW 
APPLIES AND THE NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT IS THEREFORE 

UNENFORCEABLE 

 
81. Mr. Papermaster repeats and realleges as though fully set forth herein the 

allegations of Paragraphs 68 through 75 as Paragraph 81 of Count 2 above. 

82. Mr. Papermaster has resided and worked in Texas for the past 17 years and is 

going to work for Apple in California. 



  NY\1469151.5 
 

  

 

15

83. Mr. Papermaster has no substantial relationship to New York, but rather he has 

the most significant contacts with Texas and California.   

84. Texas and California hold that noncompetition agreements such as IBM’s are 

unenforceable as a matter of public policy.   

85. The fundamental polices of Texas and California are contrary to the application of 

New York law.   

86. Mr. Papermaster is entitled to a declaratory judgment that Texas or California law 

applies, and as a result, that the Noncompetition Agreement is unenforceable.   

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 

 
WHEREFORE, Defendant and Counterclaim-Plaintiff Mr. Papermaster prays for 

judgment as follows: 

a. Judgment against IBM in favor of Mr. Papermaster for the claims brought 

by IBM; 

b. Declaratory judgment that the Noncompetition Agreement is unreasonably 

overbroad and unenforceable; 

c. Declaratory judgment that Texas or California law applies, and as a result, 

that the Noncompetition Agreement is unenforceable; 

d. Reasonable costs and disbursements herein; 

e. Attorneys fees and costs to the extent recoverable by law; and 



  NY\1469151.5 
 

  

 

16

f. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
