(f)	Recording.  Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or employees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording.

(g)	Setoff. (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, “X”) may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, “Y”) in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or  under any other agreement(s), instrument(s), or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X’sAffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s), or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X’s Affiliates.

For purposes of this Section, “Owed” shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.

Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.
(B)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s), or undertaking(s), which are Owed  as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.

	(j)	Transfer.  Section 7 of the ISDA Form is hereby amended by (1) adding in the third line thereof after the word “party” the words “which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed”, and (2) adding the following subsection (c):


(c)	Party A may transfer, without restriction, its rights, obligations and interests (including rights to payments) hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate so long as the obligations of such Affiliate are guaranteed by Enron Corp. pursuant to a guaranty substantially similar to the one provided on behalf of Party A, provided that such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default. 


		Party B may transfer, without restriction, its rights, obligations and interests (including     

rights to payments) hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate, provided that such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default.

(l)	Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any party or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable (in whole or in part) for any reason, the remaining terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if this Agreement had been executed with the invalid or unenforceable portion eliminated, so long as this Agreement as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter of this Agreement and the deletion of such portion of this Agreement will not substantially impair the respective benefits or expectations of the parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that this severability provision shall not be applicable if any provision of Section 1, 2, 5 or 6 (or any definition or provision in Section 14 to the extent it relates to, or is used in or in connection with any such Section) shall be so held to be invalid or unenforceable.


(m)	Additional Representations.  For the purpose of Section 3 of the Agreement, Party B further represents and warrants to Party A (which representations will be deemed repeated by Party B at all times until the termination of this Agreement and any Transactions) that:

The delivery of documents pursuant to Part 3 of this Schedule shall not be required in connection with Existing Transactions.  To the extent the terms herein conflict with the terms of the agreements governing the Existing Transactions, the terms of this Agreement shall apply, unless the parties expressly agree in a writing signed by both parties that the Existing Transactions will apply.

We have also reviewed certain corporate proceedings of the Counterparty, and we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Counterparty, certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Counterparty and such other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.  In such examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified or otherwise satisfactorily identified copies.  We have also assumed that the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by you pursuant to appropriate corporate authority.  The opinions given below are limited to matters concerning the laws of the United States of America.


		Based upon the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of opinion that:


	1.  The Counterparty is a corporation duly existing under the laws of Bermuda.


	2.  The Counterparty has full corporate power to execute and deliver the Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.


	3.  Such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not violate, and are not in conflict with any provision of law or of the corporate charter and related documents of the Counterparty.


	4.  All authorizations of, exemptions by and filings with any governmental, regulatory body or other authority that are required to be obtained or made in connection with the Counterparty’s execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement have been obtained or made and are valid and subsisting.


	5.  The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Counterparty and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Counterparty enforceable against the Counterparty in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally from time to time in effect).  Obligations of any branch of the Counterparty are for all purposes obligations of the Counterparty, enforceable against the Counterparty to the same extent set forth in the next preceding sentence.  The enforceability of the Counterparty’s obligations is also subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).


	6.  The choice of law provision set forth in the Agreement is valid and binding under the laws of Bermuda and any political subdivision thereof and would be given effect by the courts of Bermuda and any political subdivision thereof.


Very truly yours

(2) Posted Collateral may be held only in the following jurisdictions:  Any jurisdiction within the United States.


(3) The Custodian is a Qualified Institution (as defined below), approved by Party B (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).

The Custodian shall hold the Posted Collateral in a segregated, safekeeping or custody account within the Custodian with the title of such account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the ownership of Party A, subject to the security interest of Party B.


If a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to this Section, then it shall be considered a “Downgraded Party” or a “Downgraded Custodian”, as the case may be (as defined in Paragraph 13(g)(ii)) and Posted Collateral shall be maintained in accordance with Paragraph 13(g)(ii).


(ii)  Use of Posted Collateral.

The provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will apply to the parties; provided, however, that if a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to Paragraph 13(g)(i) (the event that caused it or its Custodian, if any, to be ineligible to hold Posted Collateral shall be a “Credit Rating Event”; if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party, such party shall be the “Downgraded Party”; and if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party’s Custodian, such Custodian shall be the “Downgraded Custodian”), then:


(1)  the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will not apply with respect to the Downgraded Party as the Secured Party for so long as both the Secured Party or its Custodian, if any, remain a Downgraded Party or a Downgraded Custodian, respectively.


(2)  the Downgraded Party shall be required to deliver (or cause the Downgraded Custodian to deliver, as the case may be) not later than the close of business on the second Local Business Day following such Credit Rating Event all Posted Collateral in its possession or held on its behalf to a commercial bank or trust company organized under the law of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, with a Credit Rating of at least “A-” in the case of S&P or “A3” in the case of Moody’s (“Qualified Institution”), approved by the non-Downgraded Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to a segregated, safekeeping or custody account (“Collateral Account”) within such Qualified Institution with the title of the Collateral Account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the Downgraded Party; provided, that, if the Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party’s Custodian that is holding Posted Collateral on behalf of such party, then such Downgraded Custodian may also deliver such Posted Collateral to such party.  The Qualified Institution shall serve as Custodian with respect to the Posted Collateral in the Collateral Account, and shall hold such Posted Collateral in accordance with the terms of this Annex and for the security interest of the Downgraded Party and, subject to such security interest, for the ownership of the non-Downgraded Party.


(3)   So long as the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) do not apply, the Qualified Institution holding the Posted Collateral will invest and reinvest or procure the investment and reinvestment of the Posted Collateral in accordance with the written instructions of the Pledgor, subject to the approval of such instructions by the Secured Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that the Qualified Institution shall not be required to so invest or reinvest or procure such investment or reinvestment if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Pledgor shall have occurred and be continuing.  The Secured Party shall have no responsibility for any losses resulting from any investment or reinvestment effected in accordance with the Pledgor’s instructions.

 

(iii)  For purposes of Section 5(a)(iii) of this Agreement, failure by a party or its Custodian to comply with any of the obligations under this Paragraph 13(g) will constitute an Event of Default with respect to such party if the failure continues for two (2) Local Business Days after notice of the failure is given to that party.

If Transfer of an Interest Amount (or any portion thereof) to a Pledgor on any day would result in, or increase, a Delivery Amount (treating the day as a Valuation Date, as provided in Paragraph 6(d)(ii)) but the Pledgor would nonetheless have no obligation to make a Transfer pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) on that day if it were a Valuation Date (because the Delivery Amount is lower than the Pledgor’s Minimum Transfer Amount or otherwise), the Secured Party will be required to Transfer that Interest Amount (or portion thereof) to the Pledgor, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 6(d)(ii).


(i)	Additional Representation(s) and Covenants.

Each party represents and covenants to the other party (which representations and covenants will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it, as the Pledgor, Transfers Eligible Credit Support (or, in the case of after-acquired Eligible Credit Support, at the time the other party or its agent acquires rights therein), and which covenants will be deemed to apply at all times) that with respect to the issuance, renewal, substitution, or increase (as the case may be) of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit is the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Issuer thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms.


(j)	Other Eligible Support and Other Posted Support.

(i)  “Value” with respect to Other Eligible Support and Other Posted Support means:  The Valuation Percentage times the stated amount then available under the Letter of Credit to be unconditionally drawn by the Secured Party.

WHEREAS, COMMERCIAL RISK REINSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED, a company organized under the law of Bermuda (“Counterparty”) and ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP.  (“Enron”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor, are contemplating entering into one or more swap, option or other financially-settled derivative transactions, which transactions will be evidenced by one or more swap agreements, confirmations and/or master agreements, including without limitation, the Master Agreement of even date herewith (the “Master Agreement”) (all such swap, option or other financially-settled derivative transactions and the agreements evidencing same, including without limitation, the Master Agreement, whether entered into prior to, on or after the date hereof, as the same may from time to time be modified, amended and supplemented, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “Contract”); and 


WHEREAS, Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the transactions to be entered into between Enron and Counterparty;


NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of Counterparty entering into the Contract, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

Subject to the provisions hereof, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and timely payment when due of each and every one of the obligations of Enron (the “Obligations”) to Counterparty under the Contract.  This Guaranty shall constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  The Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty may be enforced by the Beneficiary without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral.  Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall not be discharged or affected by (i) the enforcement of failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the Contracts, (ii) the bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or winding-up of Enron, or (iii) the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of, or any defect in, any of the Contracts or this Guaranty or any term or provision thereof or hereof or of any of the respective obligations thereunder or hereunder.  The liability of Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be subject to the following:

(a)  Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under the Contract (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and hereunder and, except to the extent specifically provided in the Contract, in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, tort, or any other damages, costs, or attorney’s fees.

(b)  The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty shall not exceed U.S. $15,000,000.

3.  DEMANDS AND NOTICE.  Upon the failure or refusal of Enron to pay any amount of any of the Obligations and/or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Termination Event, if Counterparty elects to exercise its rights under this Guaranty, Counterparty shall make a demand upon Guarantor (hereinafter referred to as a “Payment Demand”).  A Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount Enron has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific statement that Counterparty is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guaranty. A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must pay the Obligations within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the Payment Demand. A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default, until Enron or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured.


4.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:

(a)	it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the Guaranty;
