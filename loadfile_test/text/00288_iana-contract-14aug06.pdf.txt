The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities to perform the following the Statement of 
Work/Specifications 
 
C.1. BACKGROUND

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 4 

 

C.1.1 The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA) has initiated this agreement to maintain the continuity and stability of services related to certain 
interdependent Internet technical management functions, known collectively as the Internet Assigned 
Numbers Authority (IANA). 

 
C.1.2 Initially, these interdependent technical functions were performed on behalf of the Government under a 

contract between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the University of 
Southern California (USC), as part of a research project known as the Terranode Network Technology 
(TNT).  As the TNT project neared completion and the DARPA/USC contract neared expiration in 1999, 
the Government recognized the need for the continued performance of the IANA functions as vital to the 
stability and correct functioning of the Internet.  On December 24, 1998, USC entered into a transition 
agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) under which 
ICANN secured directly from USC, all necessary resources, including key personnel, intellectual property, 
and computer facility access critical to the continued performance of the IANA functions.  Having 
assumed these key resources (as well as other responsibilities associated with privatization of the Internet 
domain name system), ICANN was uniquely positioned to undertake performance of these functions.  On 
February 8, 2000, March 21, 2001,and then on March 13, 2003, the DoC entered into an agreement with 
ICANN to perform the IANA functions.  In connection with its work under these agreements, ICANN has 
developed and maintained close, constructive working relationships with a variety of interested parties, 
including Internet standards development organizations and technical bodies. 

 
C.1.3 The Government acknowledges that data submitted by applicants in connection with the IANA function is 

confidential information.  To the extent permitted by law, the Government shall accord any data submitted 
by applicants in connection with the IANA functions with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its 
own confidential information, but not less than reasonable care, to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure 
or publication of confidential information.  In providing data that is subject to such a confidentiality 
obligation to the Government, the Contractor shall advise the Government of that obligation. 

 
C.2 CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS 
 
C.2.1 The Contractor must perform the required services for this purchase order as a prime Contractor, not as an 

agent or subcontractor.  The Contractor must possess and maintain through the performance of this 
acquisition a physical address within the United States.  The Government reserves the right to inspect the 
premises, systems, and processes of all security and operational components used for the performance of 
these requirements. 

 
C.2.2 The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to 

perform the following requirements without any cost to the Government.  On or after the effective date of 
this purchase order, the Contractor may establish and collect fees from third parties (i.e,  other than the 
Government) for the functions performed under this purchase order, provided the fee levels are approved 
by the Contracting Officer before going into effect, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably and 
provided the fee levels are fair and equitable and provided the aggregate fees charged during the term of 
this purchase order do not exceed the cost of providing the requirements of this purchase order.  The 
Government will review the Contractor’s accounting data at anytime fees are charged to verify that the 
above conditions are being met. 

 
C.2.2.1 DoC NTIA has a requirement for a Contractor to maintain the operation of the Internet by performing the 

IANA functions.  In performance of this purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary 
personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the 
following IANA requirements.

(2) Before providing any material support or resources to an individual or entity, the Contractor will consider 
all information about that individual or entity of which it is aware and all public information that is 
reasonably available to it or of which it should be aware. 

 
(3) The Contractor also will implement reasonable monitoring and oversight procedures to safeguard against 

assistance being diverted to support terrorist activity. 
 

(b)  For the purposes of this certification, the Contractor's obligations under paragraph "a" are not applicable to the 
procurement of goods and/or services by the Contractor that are acquired in the ordinary course of business through 
contract or purchase, e.g., utilities, rents, office supplies, gasoline, unless the Contractor has reason to believe that a 
vendor or supplier of such goods and services commits, attempts to commit, advocates, facilitates or participates in 
terrorist acts, or has committed, attempted to commit, facilitated or participated in terrorist acts. 
 
(c)  This certification is an express term and condition of any agreement issued as a result of this application, and 
any violation of it shall be grounds for unilateral termination of the agreement by DoC prior to the end of its term.

settlement of claims arising under or relating to this contract until such appeals, litigation, or claims are finally 
resolved.

(3) That requires the subcontractor to furnish reports as discussed in paragraph (e) of this clause. 
The clause may be altered only as necessary to identify properly the contracting parties and the Contracting Officer 
under the Government prime contract.

preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice 
does not commit the Government to an extension.  
 
(b)  If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.   
 
(c)  The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed

I.6 PATENT RIGHTS – RETENTION BY THE CONTRACTOR (SHORT FORM) (FAR 52.227-

11)(JUN 1997) 
 
(a) Definitions. (1) “Invention” means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise 
protectable under title 35 of the United States Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected 
under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.) 
 

(2) “Made” when used in relation to any invention means the conception or first actual reduction to 
practice of such invention. 
 
(3) “Nonprofit organization” means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization 
of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and 
exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any 
nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute. 

 
(4) “Practical application” means to manufacture, in the case of a composition of product; to practice, in 
the case of a process or method, or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under 
such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that is benefits are, to the extent 
permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms. 

 
(5) “Small business firm” means a small business concern as defined at section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 
U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 16 

 

the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government 
procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used. 

 
(6) “Subject invention” means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to 
practice in the performance of work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the 
date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) 
must also occur during the period of contract performance. 

 
(b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world 
to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject 
invention in which the Contractor retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, 
irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention 
throughout the world. 
 
(c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent application by Contractor. (1) The Contractor will 
disclose each subject invention to the Federal agency within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to 
Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written 
report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be 
sufficiently complete in technical 
detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, 
operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall 
also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the 
invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of 
disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the 
Contractor. 
 

(2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the 
Federal agency within 2 years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where 
publication, on sale or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection 
can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to 
a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period. 

 
(3) The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain 
title within 1 year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid 
patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The 
Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 
10 months of the corresponding initial patent application or 6 months from the date permission is granted 
by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has 
been prohibited by a Secrecy Order. 

 
(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure election, and filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and 
(3) of this clause may, at the discretion of the agency, be granted.  

 
(d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor will convey to the Federal agency, upon 
written request, title to any subject invention— 
 

(1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in 
paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that the agency may only request title 
within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Contractor to disclose or elect within the specified times. 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 17 

 

(2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in 
paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a 
country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written 
request of the Federal agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country. 
 
(3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, 
to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention. 

 
(e) Minimum rights to Contractor and protection of the Contractor right to file. (1) The Contractor will retain a 
nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains 
title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this 
clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate 
structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the 
extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable 
only with the approval of the Federal agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the 
Contractor's business to which the invention pertains. 
 

(2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the funding Federal agency to the 
extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an 
application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 
and agency licensing regulations (if any). This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the 
geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the 
benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be 
revoked or modified at the discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent the Contractor, its 
licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that 
foreign country. 

 
(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding Federal agency will furnish the 
Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be 
allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the funding Federal agency for good cause 
shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or 
modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable  regulations in 37 CFR 
part 404 and agency regulations, if any, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any 
decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license. 

 
(f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed 
and promptly deliver to the Federal agency all instruments necessary to— 
 

(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to 
which the Contractor elects to retain title; and 
(ii) Convey title to the Federal agency when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the 
Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention. 

 
(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and  
nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made 
under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to 
establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 18 

 

minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such 
employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of 
reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign 
statutory bars. 

 
(3) The Contractor will notify the Federal agency of any decisions not to continue the prosecution of a 
patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a 
patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the 
relevant patent office. 

 
(4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and 
any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was 
made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). 
The Government has certain rights in the invention.” 

 
(g) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all 
subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or domestic nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the 
Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, 
obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions. 
 

(2) The Contractor will include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, 
developmental, or research work the patent rights clause required by Subpart 27.3. 

 
(3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, the agency, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and 
the Federal agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in 
this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with 
proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause. 

 
(h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no 
more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that 
are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the 
status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such 
other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional 
reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the agency in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency agrees it will not 
disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor. 
 
(i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees 
that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the 
United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the 
use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, 
the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the Federal agency upon a showing by the Contractor or 
its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential 
licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. 
 
(j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, 
the Federal agency has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 19 

 

regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant 
a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, 
upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee 
refuses such a request the Federal agency has the right to grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines 
that— 
 

(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take 
within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application 
of the subject invention in such field of use; 

 
(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the 
Contractor, assignee, or their licensees; 

 
(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such 
requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or 

 
(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been 
obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the 
United States is in breach of such agreement. 

 
(k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it 
agrees that— 
 

(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the 
Federal agency, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary 
functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same 
provisions as the Contractor; 

 
(2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including 
Federal employee co-inventors (when the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is 
assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10; 

 
(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, 
after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject 
inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and 

 
(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject 
inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when 
licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or 
proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to 
practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, 
that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry 
out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the 
discretion of the contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review 
the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor 
will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce 
when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively 
implement the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4).

(l) Communications. [Complete according to agency instructions.]  The Government reserves the right to establish 
procedures regarding communications after contract award.  Such procedures shall be subject to the mutual 
agreement of the parties.

under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).  
 
“Made” when used in relation to any invention means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of such 
invention.  
 
“Nonprofit organization” means a domestic university or other institution of higher education or an organization of 
the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from 
taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or 
educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.  
 
“Practical application” means to manufacture in the case of a composition or product, to practice in the case of a 
process or method, or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to 
establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government 
regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.  
 
“Small business firm” means a small business concern as defined at section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) 
and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the purpose of this 
clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 
13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.  
 
“Subject invention” means any invention of the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the 
performance of work under this contract; provided, that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination 
(as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the 
period of contract performance.  
 
(b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may elect to retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout 
the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any 
subject invention in which the Contractor elects to retain title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the 
subject invention throughout the world.  
 
(c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent applications by Contractor.  
 

(1) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the 
inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or within 6 months after 
the Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, whichever is earlier. The disclosure to the 
Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the 
invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear 
understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, 
chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any 
publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 21 

 

submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In 
addition, after disclosure to the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use 
planned by the Contractor.  
 
(2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the 
Federal agency at the time of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries (including the 
United States) in which the Contractor will retain title; provided, that in any case where publication, on sale, or 
public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the 
United States, the period of election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 
60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.  
 
(3) The Contractor shall file its initial patent application on an elected invention within 1 year after election or, 
if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United 
States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor shall file patent applications in additional 
countries (including the European Patent Office and under the Patent Cooperation Treaty) within either 
10 months of the corresponding initial patent application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the 
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been 
prohibited by a Secrecy Order.  
 
(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to the Contracting Officer, election, and filing may, at the 
discretion of the funding Federal agency, be granted, and will normally be granted unless the Contracting 
Officer has reason to believe that a particular extension would prejudice the Government’s interest. 

  
(d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor shall convey to the Federal agency, upon 
written request, title to any subject invention—  
 

(1) If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject invention;  
 
(2) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of 
this clause (the agency may only request title within 60 days after learning of the Contractor’s failure to report 
or elect within the specified times);  
 
(3) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the time specified in 
paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country 
after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the 
Federal agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country; or  
 
(4) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay 
the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject 
invention.  

 
(e) Minimum rights to Contractor.  

(1) The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject 
invention to which the Government obtains title except if the Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention 
within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor’s license extends to its domestic 
subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and includes 
the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the 
time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the funding Federal agency 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 22 

 

except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor’s business to which the invention 
pertains.  
 
(2) The Contractor’s domestic license may be revoked or modified by the funding Federal agency to the extent 
necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an 
exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in the Federal Property Management 
Regulations and agency licensing regulations (if any). This license shall not be revoked in that field of use or the 
geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits 
of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or 
modified at the discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its 
domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.  
 
(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding Federal agency shall furnish the Contractor a 
written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor shall be allowed 30 days (or 
such other time as may be authorized by the funding Federal agency for good cause shown by the Contractor) 
after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right 
to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency licensing regulations and 37 CFR 404 concerning the licensing 
of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.  

 
(f) Contractor action to protect the Government’s interest.  

(1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the Federal agency all 
instruments necessary to—  
 
(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which 
the Contractor elects to retain title; and  
(ii) Convey title to the Federal agency when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and paragraph (n)(2) of 
this clause, and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject 
invention.  
 
(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical 
employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent 
matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers 
necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government’s rights in the subject 
inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) 
of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees through employee agreements or other suitable 
educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent 
applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.  
 
(3) The Contractor shall notify the Federal agency of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent 
application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any 
country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.  
 
(4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any 
patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: “This invention was made with 
Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The Government 
has certain rights in this invention.”  
 
(5) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that subject inventions 
are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months of 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 23 

 

conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in performance of work under this 
contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and 
other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to 
practice of subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the 
inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such 
procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.  
 
(6) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to arrange to avoid royalty charges on 
acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through Military Assistance Program of the 
Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges 
on the subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in 
any instrument transferring rights in the invention to any party.  
 
(7) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:  
(i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from 
the date of the contract, listing subject inventions during that period and stating that all subject inventions have 
been disclosed or that there are no such inventions.  
(ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all subject inventions or 
stating that there were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights 
clause or stating that there were no such subcontracts.  
 
(8) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at 
any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the 
work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and no more frequently than 
annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.  
 
(9) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept one of the clauses in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) 
of this clause, the Contractor—  
(i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor’s reasons for 
such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and  
(ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontracting without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  
 
(10) The Contractor shall provide, upon request, the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent 
application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and patent number 
and issue date for any subject invention for which the Contractor has retained title.  
 
(11) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make 
copies of the patent application file.  

 
(g) Subcontracts.  
 

(1) The Contractor shall include the clause at 52.227-11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), suitably 
modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or 
research work to be performed by a small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subcontractor shall retain 
all rights provided for the Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for 
awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor’s subject inventions.  
 
(2) The Contractor shall include this clause (FAR 52.227-12) in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for 
experimental, developmental, or research work.  



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 24 

 

 
(3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award with the Federal agency was a contract (but 
not a grant or cooperative agreement), the agency, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual 
obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Federal 
agency with respect to those matters covered by this clause.  

 
(h) Reporting utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more 
frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are 
being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the 
status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such 
other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional 
reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by the agency 
in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. To the extent data or information supplied under this paragraph is 
considered by the Contractor, its licensee or assignee to be privileged and confidential and is so marked, the agency 
agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the 
Government.  
 
(i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees 
that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the 
United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured 
substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be 
waived by the Federal agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful 
efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially 
feasible.  
 
(j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, 
the Federal agency has the right in accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.304-1(g) to require the Contractor, an 
assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive 
license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the 
circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, the Federal agency has 
the right to grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines that—  
 

(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a 
reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;  
 
(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the 
Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;  
 
(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such 
requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or 
  
(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been 
obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States is in breach of such agreement.  

 
(k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. [Reserved]  
 
(l) Communications. [Complete according to agency instructions.]  
 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 25 

 

(m) Other inventions. Nothing contained in this clause shall be deemed to grant to the Government any rights with 
respect to any invention other than a subject invention.  
 
(n) Examination of records relating to inventions.  
 

(1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this 
contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the 
Contractor relating to the conception or first reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology 
as the work under this contract to determine whether—  
 
(i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;  
(ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures required by paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this 
clause; and  
(iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.  
 
(2) If the Contracting Officer determines that an inventor has not disclosed a subject invention to the Contractor 
in accordance with the procedures required by paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may, 
within 60 days after the determination, request title in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
clause. However, if the Contractor establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from the Contractor’s 
fault or negligence, the Contracting Officer shall not request title.  
 
(3) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention which the Contracting Officer 
believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to the agency for a 
determination of ownership rights.  
 
(4) Any examination of records under this paragraph shall be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the 
confidentiality of the information involved.  

 
(o) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).  

(1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government’s 
interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of the contract, 
whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, the Contractor fails to—  
 
(i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions 
pursuant to paragraph (f)(5) of this clause;  
(ii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;  
(iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subdivision (f)(7)(i) of this clause; or  
(iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (f)(8) of this clause.  
 
(2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor 
has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information 
required by this clause.  
 
(3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer 
all disclosures of subject inventions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, an acceptable final report 
pursuant to subdivision (f)(7)(ii) of this clause, and all past due confirmatory instruments.  
 
(4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. 
No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 26 

 

withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment 
thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.  

 
I.8 RIGHTS IN DATA – EXISTING WORKS (FAR 52.227-18)(JUN 1087) 
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its 
behalf, a paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform 
publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government, for all the material or subject matter called for 
under this contract, or for which this clause is specifically made applicable. 
 
(b) The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, agents, and employees acting for the 
Government against any liability, including costs and expenses, incurred as the result of (1) the violation of trade 
secrets, copyrights, or right of privacy or publicity, arising out of the creation, delivery, publication or use of any 
data furnished under this contract; or (2) any libelous or other unlawful matter contained in such data. The 
provisions of this paragraph do not apply unless the Government provides notice to the Contractor as soon as 
practicable of any claim or suit, affords the Contractor an opportunity under applicable laws, rules, or regulations to 
participate in the defense thereof, and obtains the Contractor’s consent to the settlement of any suit or claim other 
than as required by final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and do not apply to material furnished to the 
Contractor by the Government and incorporated in data to which this clause applies.

APPENDIX A  -  PROCESSING METRICS 
 

PROCESS FOR IANA ROOT MANAGEMENT REQUESTS 
 
Specific Steps to Process a Change Request
 
Request received by the Contractor  -- The Contractor receives request to make changes to the root-zone and/or the 
authoritative WHOIS database.  The date of receipt is the date upon which the Contractor receives a request, on a 
business day, during the hours of 9:00 am and 5:00 pm Pacific Time. 
 
Confirmation of Receipt -- Within three (3) business days of the date of receipt, the Contractor shall send 
confirmation of receipt of the request and a transaction number to the Requester. 
 
Contractor reviews request -- The submission is reviewed to determine the details of the changes requested.  
During this process, Contractor determines whether the request contains all of the information necessary to 
commence processing (complete request), or the request requires additional information or clarification from the 
Requester (incomplete request).  If a request is complete, the Contractor shall commence Request Processing. 
 
Notice of deficiency-- In the event that the request is deemed incomplete, the Contractor shall, within seven (7) 
calendar days of the date of receipt, provide to the Requester a notice of deficiency.  This notice shall offer a 
detailed description of the deficiency(ies) in the request.  
 
Deficiency cure-- A Requester must promptly cure any deficiency in a request.  If a Requester fails to cure any 
deficiency in its request within fourteen (14) calendar days of the notice of deficiency, then the Contractor will 
deem the request closed.  Multiple communications between the Requester and the Contractor may be necessary to 
ensure that deficiencies are clearly understood by all parties.  Once the Contractor has determined that the 
Requester has cured the deficiency(ies), the Contractor shall deem the request complete and shall commence 
request processing.  
 



 
 
 

SA1301-06-CN-0048 
Page - 28 

 

Request Processing -- Within seven (7) calendar days of a request being deemed complete, Contractor shall send to 
Requester a notice of confirmation of requested changes.  Requester shall provide confirmation of the requested 
changes within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of such notice from Contractor.  If Contractor does not receive 
confirmation within seven (7) calendar days, Contractor shall send a second and final notice to Requester giving 
Requester an additional seven (7) calendar days to provide the required confirmation.  If Requester fails to provide 
such confirmation after the second and final notice, then such request shall be deemed incomplete and shall be 
closed.  Contractor shall deliver notification of the request closure to Requester within one (1) business day of 
closing the request.  Contractor shall provide Requester with a grace period during which time if the Requester 
provides confirmation to Contractor within thirty (30) days of a request closure, the request shall be re-opened and 
processed as a completed and confirmed request.  Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date that the request was 
deemed completed and confirmed, Contractor shall complete all processing and issue a report with a 
recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding whether the proposed changes should be 
authorized.
