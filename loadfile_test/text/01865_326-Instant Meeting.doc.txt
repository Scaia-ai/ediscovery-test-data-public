Instant Meeting



MCI WorldCom Audioconferencing’s Instant Meeting is a reservationless conferencing service that allows a conference call leader to conduct a call without contacting the MCIWorldCom Conferencing reservation center first.  MCIWorldCom will assign each leader a personal dial-in number, a leader passcode and a participant passcode that can be used repeatedly for “Instant Meetings”.  To conduct a meeting, the leader simply distributes the dial-in number and participant passcode to all meeting participants and tells them when the meeting will occur.



FEATURES AND BENEFITS 


No advanced reservations required

The customer does not need to worry about advanced reservations, and no interaction with a reservation center is necessary to set up or modify a reservation.  This saves administrative time spent setting up a reservation and distributing call information, and allows for spontaneous meetings with a minimum amount of pre-planning.  The only requirement is that the Instant Meeting account be activated at least once every 60 days.

Ability to hold meetings at a moment’s notice

Allows the customer to set up a meeting any time, at a moment’s notice, without advanced reservations.  This is perfect for unexpected crisis or “on-the-fly” management meetings.


Always the same dial-in number

The same dial-in number (toll, toll-free or MCIWorldcom On-Net/vnet) and passcodes are used for each meeting.  This cuts down on confusion among participants and requires participants only to keep track of one number and passcode.


Provides Secure Access

By providing the customer with a leader passcode and a separate participant passcode, Instant Meeting provides secure access for the customer’s meetings.  Participants cannot begin the meeting until the leader joins the call.  The leader also has the option of changing the passcodes, as necessary.
