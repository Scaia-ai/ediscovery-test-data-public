This holiday season, the EWS Legal Department has adopted four third-grade children  (2 boys and 2 girls) from Gordon Elementary School.


For more than a dozen years, Enron has adopted a Houston-area school and delivered holiday gifts to the students, including toys, clothing, and school uniforms. The school invited to participate in the Enron Kids program is chosen each year based on its overall academic progress and achievements.  This year, Gordon Elementary School has been chosen.  



Gordon Elementary School is an HISD relief school for overcrowded and capped schools in Southwest Houston.  Students are bussed to Gordon from the Gulfton, Fondren Southwest and Westbury areas.  Children who attend class at Gordon are primarily immigrants, refugees, and first generation Americans. The majority of these children come from families who don’t have money to provide their children with basic essentials.  
These children are in dire need of underwear, socks, shoes, coats, basic essentials that we take for granted. As many of these childrens’ parents wrestle with the dilemma of how to put food on the table, oftentimes, the notion of buying toys is out of the question. 



The joy of feeling special, getting new clothes, and having a new toy to play with is something everyone should experience.  Please help us give that kind of special moment to these children. 
No donation is too small!  Please contact Stephanie Truss, 5-3861, or Martha Keesler, 5-2423, to make a cash donation.  The deadline for making your cash donation is Thursday, December 7, 2001.  Stephanie and Martha will personally go shopping for clothes and toys, and will represent EWS Legal at the holiday party at Gordon Elementary School on December 20, 2001.

Response this year is EXTREMELY low!  Your help is greatly appreciated!
