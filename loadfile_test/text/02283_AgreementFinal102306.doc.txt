Exhibit A

A. 	OVERVIEW 


This is the Statement of Work (SOW) for the contract for purchase card services.  This SOW along with the Contractor’s response to the purchase card services requirements (administrative and technical) contains the Contractor’s responsibilities.


B.	STATEMENT OF WORK

1.	Purpose


This Statement of Work (SOW) gives an overview of the purchasing card services and technologies under this Master Services Agreement (MSA) to be provided to the State of California, Department of General Services (DGS) CAL-Card Program and the participating agencies.  

2.	Period of Performance


	The period of performance for this MSA contract shall be for five (5) years, beginning with the Effective Date of this Agreement, with, at the State’s option, one (1) two (2) year extension.  During the initial term, neither DGS nor the Contractor may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, except by mutual consent or as otherwise provided under Exhibit C to this document, General Terms and Conditions.

	3.	CAL-Card Program

In May 1990, the California Department of General Services (DGS) published a report titled “Using a Bank Card for Small State Purchases.”  The report recommended that the State conduct a pilot project to test the advantages and disadvantages of employing purchase cards for small dollar purchases of commodities.  


In 1992 the DGS awarded an 18 month competitively bid pilot contract that called for six state agencies to run a pilot program.  Because the pilot program was so successful, the contract was renewed and made available for all state and local governmental agencies. 

Since that time two sequential contracts have been competitively bid and awarded for continued purchase card services.  The first contract term was three years fixed with two one-year options for extension and the second was a two year fixed with four one-year options for extension.  


The CAL-Card Program allows State and Local Governmental Agencies to utilize the Master Services Agreement through a contract addendum process.  The CAL-Card Program has been extremely successful in providing California state and Local Government Agencies with purchase card services and continues to experience year-over-year growth in individual program usage and new participating agencies.


Finally, On July 24, 1996, The State of California officially named its purchase card program “CAL-Card“ and registered the name under a certified service mark.





4.	Western State Contract Alliance (WSCA)


The State of California has been designated as the lead state for this project and will work in a collaborative manner with its contractor and partners in the Western States Contract Alliance (WSCA) to make the State of California contract available to any WSCA state wishing to participate.  WSCA states that choose to participate may have standardized terms and conditions that differ slightly from the State of California’s.  The Contractor and the WSCA state will work together to incorporate these differences and develop a mutually acceptable agreement between the WSCA state and Contractor. 


	5.	Agency Enrollment and Implementation

The State will use this one basic design as the standard card stock to be used by all CAL-Card participants.  The State reserves the right to change the card design during the contract period at no charge to the State and if doing so, will provide the Contractor with the artwork needed to make.  

State and Local Governmental Agencies shall have the ability to customize the standard card stock.

c.	Card Limits and Restrictions 


The State desires a purchase card with extremely flexible card limits and widest possible merchant category code restrictions available.

The Contract Manager and each Participating Agency will have the flexibility to have the Contractor apply limits and restrictions.

The CAL-Card Program shall be available for use by individual government employees.  Issuance of a card to any employee must be done with prior written or an alternative secured method of approval by the Participating Agency’s Program Coordinator.

Participating Agencies intend to pay according to the contract payment terms; however, in instances of dispute the charges may be placed in suspense until there is resolution.  The Contractor will propose a timely dispute procedure to ensure that the payment network charge back rights do not expire.  If upon resolution of a dispute it is found that the transaction was actually an authorized charge, the Participating Agency will be liable for the payment within the payment terms as described in Section 11.  Service Capabilities, b. Payment Term and Late Payment Penalties.


The Contractor shall provide detailed information on the proposed disputed transaction resolution procedures.

g.	Liability 


Participating Agencies shall only be liable for the use of their purchase cards on acquisitions that are authorized transactions.  Authorized transactions are defined as acquisitions which meet the following requirements:

The Participating Agency receives the product, commodity, service, etc.

A transaction involving fraudulent or wrongful use of a CAL-Card or account by an authorized employee of a Participating Agency or any other person with an authorized employee’s actual, implied, or apparent authority shall constitute an authorized transaction, and the Participating Agency would be liable for the charges, unless the Participating Agency terminates the employee in question and applies for the Visa Liability Waiver Program to protect it from liability of charges resulting in products or services that do not benefit the Participating Agency directly or indirectly.

The State and all Participating Agencies shall have no liability for lost or stolen cards or fraudulent use of any purchase card.

The Contractor understands that these requirements are to support mandatory, statutory reporting requirements of contracting activity and the Contractor understands that there are specific reporting requirements that must be met in this report development effort.


b.	Payment Term and Late Payment Penalties


The Contractor will be responsible for operating a payment system that interfaces with the Participating Agencies’ accounting/billing systems.  It will be a versatile system and have sufficient flexibility to interface with the Participating Agencies’ automated accounting and billing systems.  Each Participating Agency will be financially responsible to the awarded Contractor for their respective authorized Cardholder purchases.  The Contractor will be responsible for sending an itemized official invoice to each Participating Agency as designed for each of the billing accounts established for the   Participating Agency.  These invoices will be sent promptly after the end of each billing cycle.  It is anticipated that some participants will have multiple billing cycles per month. 


The CAL-Card Program has the following minimum payment terms:


The full amount of each Participating Agency’s monthly balance or billing cycle balance, except for disputed or reported fraud items, will be due within forty-five (45) days from the billing cycle date of the Contractor invoice.  If the Contractor’s Cardholder Statement, Approving Official Summary, or the Invoice is not postmarked within three business days after the billing cycle, the pay term can be extended the equal number of days between the third day after the billing cycle and the actual latest postmark date of the Cardholder Statement, Approving Official Summary, or the Invoice.  

Payment will be made to the Contractor via check, warrant, bank wire, automated clearing house, and/or electronic funds transfer at the Participating Agency’s option.  Payment sent via mail is considered paid on check or electronic issue date as long as postmarked by the third day after check issue date.  If the check is not postmarked by the third day after the check issue date, the check posting date will be extended the equal number of days between the third day after check issue date and the actual postmark date of the payment envelope.

Late payment penalties for undisputed payments not received by the Contractor within the specified period will be determined under California State Law.  Each Participating Agency will be required to pay such penalties based on the California Prompt Payment Act (Government Code, Section, 927) or its successor.  The penalty on any undisputed late payment shall be calculated in accordance with the penalty interest factor per day formula provided in the State of California Budget Letter 05-15, Late Payment Penalty Interest Rates (or its successor letter).

The Contractor must provide a detailed delinquent account suspension notice report, which shall be sent to the Participating Agency Director or Chief Officer, the State Department of Finance, Fiscal Systems Consulting Unit, and the CAL-Card Statewide Program Administrator, for the Participating Agencies with delinquencies greater than thirty (30) days with subsequent suspension at sixty (60) days after the date of the first billing to that Participating Agency.

The contractor must provide detailed information and electronic copies to fit 8 ½ x 11 format on the proposed payment system, including:

U.S. Bank maintains a department in our Service Center responsible for reconciling open invoices and tracking delinquent open invoices.  This department has staff dedicated to working specifically with the CAL-Card program to assist Agencies with clearing up open invoices.


If a Participating Agency does not pay their invoices in full, less disputed transactions, within fifty-five (55) days of the invoice date, the Agency will be contacted by U.S. Bank’s collections staff regarding the unpaid balances.  As well, at day fifty-five (55) after invoice date, the collection unit will report to the Department of General Services CAL-Card program management, the State Department of Finance contact named by the State, and any other Control Agency named by the State, all Participating Agencies that have undisputed past due balances. 


Reports to the State will include a spreadsheet Delinquency Report that lists Participating Agencies with past due balances sub-totaled by aging buckets.   Reports also will include an Agency-specific delinquency spreadsheet with detailed information about specific past due invoices within the Agency. 


If a Participating Agency has not paid its invoice(s) in full, less disputed items, by day sixty (60) after the invoice date, U.S. Bank may, at its discretion, suspend charging privileges for the Agency as a whole, or at the sub-division level of the Agency that is delinquent. The suspension will remain in effect until such time as the Agency or sub-division has remitted to U.S. Bank the unpaid balance and any associated accrued late payment penalty.  Any Participating Agency facing suspension will be given written notification in the form of the Notice of Delinquency.

This includes summary roll-up, review and manipulation at different hierarchical levels.


The Contractor shall also be able to provide automatic, default cost allocations for each transaction to include the ability to assign multiple account codes to each transaction as determined by the Participating Agency.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide the ability to assign a code based on the vendor category, cardholder or any combination of these fields.

The Contractor shall also provide the ability to download data from the system and the automatic creation of batch upload files containing accounting data to a Participating Agency’s internal accounting systems to include, at a minimum, a custom interface file to any internal system(s) designated by the Participating Agency.  This custom interface file shall be created in such a manner that it can be imported into the Participating Agency's system with no interaction or special programming or manual entry of transaction data.

The Contractor agrees to be fully responsible to the State for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors and or persons either directly or indirectly employed by any of them as it is for the acts and omissions or persons directly employed by the Contractor.

As a result, the State shall have no obligation to pay or to enforce the payment of any moneys to any subcontractor.


3.	Insurance Requirements

Contractor shall furnish to the State a certificate of insurance stating that there is commercial general liability and workers’ compensation insurance presently in effect for the Contractor of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage liability combined.

             hereby named as additional insured but only with respect to work performed
             for the State of California.

In the event said insurance coverage expires at any time during the term of this Contract, Contractor agrees to provide at least 30 days prior to said expiration date, a new certificate of insurance evidencing insurance coverage as provided for herein for not less than the remainder of the term of the Contract, or for a period of not less than one year.  New certificates of insurance are subject to the approval of the Department of General Services, and Contractor agrees that no work shall be performed prior to approval.  In the event the Contractor fails to keep in effect at all times insurance coverage as herein provided, the State may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate this contract.

4.	Contracts Funded by the Federal Government

It is mutually understood between the parties that this contract may have been written before ascertaining the availability of congressional appropriation of funds, for the mutual benefit of both parties, in order to avoid program and fiscal delays which would occur if the contract were executed after that determination was made.


This contract is valid and enforceable only if sufficient funds are made available to the State by the United States Government for the current and/or subsequent years covered by this Contract for the purposes of this program.  In addition, this contract is subject to any additional restrictions, limitations, or conditions enacted by the Congress or any statute enacted by the congress, which may affect the provisions, terms, or funding of this Contract in any manner.


It is mutually agreed that if the Congress does not appropriate sufficient funds for the program, this contract shall be amended to reflect any reduction in funds.


The DGS has the option to void the contract under the 30-day cancellation clause or amend the contract to reflect any reduction of funds.


5.	Federal Debarment

The Federal Department of Labor requires that State agencies which are expending Federal funds of $25,000 or more to have in the contract file, a certification by the Contractor that they have not been debarred or suspended from doing business with the Federal Government.  Each Contractor must provide this documentation upon request.


6.	DGS Termination of Contract

Unless General Provisions and Conditions, Item 7. Termination for Cause is applicable the DGS, Procurement Division and U.S. Bank may mutually agree to terminate this contract at any time upon 30 days prior written notice.  Upon termination or other expiration of this contract, each party will assist the other party in orderly termination of the contract and the transfer of all assets, tangible and intangible, as may facilitate the orderly, nondisrupted business continuation of each party.  This provision shall not relieve the contractor of the obligation to perform under any purchase order or other similar ordering document executed prior to the termination becoming effective. If applicable, Participating Agencies shall pay all outstanding invoices for services rendered on or before the termination date.   


7.	Negotiation

At the State’s sole option, the Department of General Services (DGS) reserves the right to invoke negotiations pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 6611, in accordance with existing guidelines and procedures adopted by the Department of General Services.

A.	If the issue cannot be resolved informally with the Contract Manager, Contractor shall submit, in writing, a grievance report together with any evidence to the Contract Manager’s Supervisor.

Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the written grievance report from the Contractor, the Supervisor shall make a determination on the problem, and shall respond in writing to the Contractor indicating the decision and reasons therefor.  Should the Contractor disagree with the Supervisor’s decision, Contractor may appeal to the next level, following the procedure in “Disputes”, paragraph B, listed below. 

Contractor must submit a letter of appeal to the Agency Director explaining why the Supervisor’s decision is unacceptable.  The letter must include, as an attachment, copies of the Contractor’s original grievance report, evidence originally submitted, and response from Supervisor.  Contractor’s letter of appeal must be submitted within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the Supervisor’s written decision.  The Director or designee shall, within twenty (20) working days of receipt of Contractor’s letter of appeal, review the issues raised and shall render a written decision to the Contractor.  The decision of the Director or designee shall be final.  

11.	Termination for Non-Appropriation of (State) Funds

If the term of this Contract extends into fiscal years subsequent to that in which it is approved, such continuation of the Contract is contingent on the appropriation of funds for such purpose by the Legislature.  If funds to effect such continued payment are not appropriated, Contractor agrees to take back any affected deliverables furnished under this Contract, terminate any services supplied to the State under this Contract, and relieve the State of any further obligation therefore. 
   

12. Credit Provisions
	

A.	Financial Information.  Since the establishment of a Purchasing Card Program is an extension of credit, the State shall provide sufficient information to enable Contractor to perform, at a minimum, annual credit reviews.


DGS shall provide future audited financial statements, prepared by DGS’ independent certified public accountant, upon request by Contractor, as soon as available and in any event not later than ninety-one (91) days after the end of each fiscal year of DGS.  To the extent required by Contractor to verify the credit worthiness of DGS, Contractor is authorized by DGS to obtain credit or financial information with respect to DGS that may be held by third party sources.  DGS agrees to provide to Contractor, from time to time, such other information regarding the business, operations, affairs, and financial condition of DGS as Contractor may reasonably request.

D.	Intellectual Property.  DGS and Contractor each recognizes that it has no right, title or interest, proprietary or otherwise, in or to the name or any logo, or Intellectual Property owned or licensed by the other.  DGS and Contractor each agree that, without prior written consent of the other, it shall not use the name, any logo, or Intellectual Property owned or licensed by the other.

		

		E.  Card Limits and Restrictions.  The State desires a purchase card with extremely 
flexible card limits and widest possible merchant category code restrictions available.  Upon request by DGS, the Contractor may either prevent or restrict usage of its Card Products to selected merchants based on Merchant Category Code.  To the extent this is requested, the following disclaimers apply:


1.	Restrictions.  Contractor can only enforce Merchant Category Code restrictions to the extent it receives accurate Merchant Category Code data with the Transaction authorization request.  


2.	 Incorrect Merchant Category Codes.  To the extent DGS believes a merchant has not been assigned an accurate Merchant Category Code, Contractor will advise the Association of the inaccuracy.  Whether or not the Merchant Category Code is changed is dependent upon applicable Association regulations. �
