The multi-page printout titled "Bankruptcy Book Exposure - COB 2/1/02," which contains exposure broken out by power, gas, and all other products shows exposure as gas-physical only.  

The same is true for:
National Fuel Marketing Company LLC
Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp.
San Diego Gas and Electric Company

Can we remove all of these from our "financial" list?

Eric Boyt: Note that the above listed companies might get shifted to the physical book.
