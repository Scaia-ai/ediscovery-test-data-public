	OTHER COMMENTS:
	
	This agreement is identical to an agreement signed with BP Capital Energy Fund, L.P. back in 1997.  As such,
	this agreement should be in the industrial master format.  Please forward executable documents to the counterparty.
	We also sent out a document for BP Capital Energy Equity Fund recently, that this document should resemble.
