I'm not sure what you are looking for.  The Early Termination Date is one of the columns contained on the Master Termination Log and the EPMI Termination Log.  If you are looking for something else, let me know.

Would you be availavble this morning to help with this?  Some of these wholesale power C/Ps haven't terminated --e.g., Great Bay; for others, the clearest information will be on my most recent 'restore services list'. Please run your work product back through me so I can eyeball it before it goes to Gerald and the Settlements group.
