Angelo,

Which counterparty are you referring to in this message.  As the email references Wexford; however, they are not a counterparty--they may represent a counterparty or counterparties.  So first let me know who you are talking about.

FYI:	As you know we have reviewed terminated in-the-money positions for mostly gas sinec the gas guys heve been more proactive about their counterparties.  Therefore, please advise as to which commodity product this counterparty has financial swaps with.   For all we know they may on one of our many lists.

Once you have answered my quiries then we can determine the status.  But as for counterparties just wnating to know the status 

I look forward to your response.
