For the one deal you mentioned, YA8712.1, it was "released" by Darren in Credit without 
any credit terms on 10/18.    Regarding the other handwritten deal numbers on that cover page, I 
believe are older (Aug or earlier) - and I only keep our credit emails a couple of months, so 
I don't know who released those - but none of them went out with credit provisions.   

I guess you should start with Darren.
