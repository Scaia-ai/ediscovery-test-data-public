Paul,

I need your help -- please furnish an executed version of the ISDA Master Agreement dated effective August 16, 2000, between Enron Credit Limited and Royal Bank of Canada.

We are trying to work through some matters and a copy of this ISDA is essential.

An electronic version if available would be great.

Thanks again.
 

Cordially, 
Susan S. Bailey
