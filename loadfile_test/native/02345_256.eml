Kerri,

Please deliver what you have, so we can start with those.

Susan,

I have all of the confirms printed out from livelink except for 4 confirms with PSCO.  The file room is still trying to locate them.  Let me know if you would like the other confirms until those deals can be located.

Thanks,

Kerri

Susan,

Attached above are the reports for each counterparty with all deals from 11/1/01 on out.  I am working on printing the confirms from Livelink.

Thanks,

Kerri
