We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.
