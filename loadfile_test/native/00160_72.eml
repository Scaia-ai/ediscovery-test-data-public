Dan & Leonard,

Wanted to let you guys know that the $3,978.00 quarterly 2001 premium due on December 3rd for the Jackson National Life Policy has gone out in today's mail.

The check for payment came out of the Chase account styled "Susan C. Sciullo or Dan A. Sciullo".  The Chase account however, was funded by Four Star.
