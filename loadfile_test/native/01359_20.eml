Sara,

Please let me know if the ISDA Master Agreement between RMT and Enron Japan Corp. is ready for execution.   The file is with you for your for initials.

You may not have initialed-off on the agreement yet -- because you were going to check with Mark as to possibly adding in the online language.   

Let me know if I may be of assistance.

Regards,
