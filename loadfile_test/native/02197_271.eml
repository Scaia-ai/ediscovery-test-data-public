Sara,

I have prepared the 3 individual Master Logs for the relevant Enron affiliates managed out of the London office (ECTRIC, Enron Credit & EFET).

You said you would help me craft my email message to Ted & Mary Nell, so I have attached my proposed message.

I look forward to your response and the revised message.

  

Cordially, 
Susan S. Bailey
