Patrick,

Please furnish a hard copy of each of the swap confirmations for:

		Deal Nos. V48090.1 & V48242.1 

These deals were referenced by the Counterparty.

However, there may be additional confirmations for other financial transactions, therefore, please those confirmations as well (if any).

Thank for all the help.
