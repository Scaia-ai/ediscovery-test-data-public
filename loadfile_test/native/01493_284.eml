As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

PS: I have a few more requests coming shortly.
