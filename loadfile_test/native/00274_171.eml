Bankruptcy 101

In an effort to educate employees about the nuts and bolts of bankruptcy, Enron is sponsoring five Bankruptcy 101 sessions next week. These sessions will focus on the basics of the bankruptcy process in general (not Enron specific).

When:	 Monday, January 28th - Friday, February 1st  from noon until 1:00 daily
Where:  5C2 in Enron Center North

Each session is limited to 50 participants, so you must RSVP if you would like to attend. Simply select a button above to indicate the date you would like to attend. You will then be sent a confirmation email. Note: This does not automatically post your calendar.  The sessions will be filling up quickly--so don't delay in reserving your spot!
