Stacey,
I did find a reference to gas purchase contract no. 96029743 and references to any all gas purchase contracts pertaining to meter nos. 821443, 830165, 830517, and 8350890.

Hi ladies,

I'm hoping you can help me with a little information on the terminations on the Master Log.  Can you provide any further information on the CNR gathering agreements being terminated for Walker & Associates?  Is ENA the agent in those agreements or the shipper? 

Any additional info will be appreciated.

Thanks,
SBR x30569
