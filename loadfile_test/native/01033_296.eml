Susan, I was hoping that you could help me locate copies of contracts (see numbers 3, 4, 5, and 8) listed on the attached document.  Maybe you could point me in the right direction if you know where I might find copies if you don't have.  Please advise asap as I need to provide to auditors.  Thanks, Deb
