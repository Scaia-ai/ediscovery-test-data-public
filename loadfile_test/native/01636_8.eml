Guys,

Please disregard the earlier message, which was sent prior to its completion.

This is the complete message.

Gentlemen,

Attached is the latest version to ENA's form of "Schedule to ISDA Master Agreement".  This document has been upgraded to include our new "set-off" provision.

For your convenience, I have attached a redlined version, so you can track the set-off language changes made therein.

              

Regards,
