All, 

I have confirmed that the following invoices for Williams Production RMT Company ("Williams"), were sent under ENA's Demand Letter dated March 1, 2002:

			Invoice Nos. 	020168809
					0202142
					020169166
					01121094
					01121761

Please note, the only Invoice not included with ENA's Demand Letter to Williams was:   0203094.  Therefore, advise as to whether this invoice also relates to Williams and why it was not included with ENA's letter of March 1st.

Further, please advise if the $7,686.87 interest check relates to all the invoices, including Invoice #0203094.

Thanks.  
	
Cordially,
