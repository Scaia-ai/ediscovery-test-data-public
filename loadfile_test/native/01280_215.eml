Here are the reports we prepared.  We only trade with 5 of the listed entities.  The reports are done individually by CP b/c we used our canned report (Flowing Deals)  instead of report writer.  If you need any other information or need the information manipulated in another way, let us know.  We can make changes as necessary.
