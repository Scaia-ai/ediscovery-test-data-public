Would you be availavble this morning to help with this?  Some of these wholesale power C/Ps haven't terminated --e.g., Great Bay; for others, the clearest information will be on my most recent 'restore services list'. Please run your work product back through me so I can eyeball it before it goes to Gerald and the Settlements group.
