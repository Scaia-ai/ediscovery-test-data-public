Leonard,

WELCOME BACK !!!!!   Hope you and Dorothy had a pleasant trip to Germany???   Hope all is well with Kasie??? I would love to hear all about it.

While you were gone, Maria Pirro contacted me -- she is with West Penn Appraisers, Inc. and she faxed their fee schedule relating to the various Sciullo Properties.

I will fax a copy to you, 
Cordially,
