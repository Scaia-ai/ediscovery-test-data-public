Behavioral Implementation†

By Geoffroy de Clippel*

Implementation theory assumes that participants’ choices are ratio-
nal, in the sense of being consistent with the maximization of a con-
text-independent preference. The paper investigates implementation 
under complete information when individuals’ choices need not be 
rational. (JEL D11, D60, D83, R31)

Implementation under complete information is a classic problem in mechanism 
design. The designer would like to implement a rule which selects acceptable out-
comes as a function of a problem’s characteristics. Unfortunately, while commonly 
known among participants, these characteristics are unknown to him. He must thus 
rely on their reports to tailor his selection of outcomes. Taking into account the par-
ticipants’ incentives to misrepresent their information, what are the rules which the 
designer can implement effectively?

Characteristics encode participants’ preferences in standard implementation mod-
els. However, there is ample evidence in marketing, psychology, and behavioral 
economics that people’s choices need not be consistent with the maximization of a 
preference relation. Classic examples, which have played a key role in recent devel-
opments in choice theory,1 include status quo biases, attraction, compromise and 
framing effects, temptation and self-control, consideration sets, and choice over-
load. This paper expands implementation theory so as to be applicable in these cir-
cumstances as well. The following examples illustrate the scope of the analysis.

(a) Hiring with Attraction Effect: Members of a hiring committee are meeting 
to select a new colleague. Up to six candidates are considered: x, y, z,  x  ∗ ,  y ∗ , and  z ∗ . 
The first three candidates are above the bar, while the last three fall below. For each

a ∈ {x, y, z},  a ∗  is similar to a, but dissimilar to other candidates. In the spirit of the 
“attraction” effect,2 the committee members’ individual choices may be influenced 
by the availability of a similar inferior alternative: e.g., choosing y out of {x, y, z}, 
but choosing x out of {x,  x  ∗ , y, z}. Finding which outcomes can be selected as a 
function of committee members’ characteristics thus falls beyond the scope of stan-
dard implementation theory.

(b) Collective Choice with Limited Willpower: Individuals in a support group 
are committing to make joint decisions. They take part in this group to achieve a 
common long-term goal. The problem is that individual choices are also influenced 
by a conflicting short-term craving. In a stylized model, think of an individual’s 
willpower as the number k of alternatives that he or she can overlook to better fulfill 
his or her long-term goal: chosen options are top-ranked according to the long-term 
goal among those which are dominated by at most k alternatives for the short-term 
craving. Such behavior need not be consistent with rationality; one may be able to 
resist eating a slice of pizza for lunch when the alternative is a salad, but unable to 
resist both the burger and the pizza slice, going for the slice if these two options are 
available on the menu in addition to the salad.3

(c) Groups as Participants: The president of a university is consulting the chairs 
of its various departments to implement a new policy. Departmental decisions may 
be reached by following some negotiation protocol. Other chairs may reach deci-
sions by aggregating their colleagues’ preferences according to some rule. Either 
way, the social choice literature teaches us that, in most cases, the chairs’ decisions 
cannot be explained through the maximization of a context-independent prefer-
ence. The scope of this paper is thus broader than accommodating people’s possible 
behavioral biases: violations of rationality also occur when individuals in the model 
represent groups of rational agents.4

In order to capture all these examples (and many more applications), states in this 
paper will encode the participants’ choice correspondences instead of preferences. 
A social choice rule (SCR) associates a set of outcomes to each state. It captures 
the goal that the mechanism designer would like to implement. Unfortunately he 
does not know the state. He must thus rely on a mechanism, which defines a set of 
messages for each individual, and a function which associates an outcome to each 
message profile. A mechanism implements a SCR if the set of equilibrium outcomes 
coincides with the set of outcomes prescribed by the SCR, at every state.

To make the definition of implementation complete, one must specify what is 
meant by an equilibrium. A strategy profile forms a Nash equilibrium when individ-
uals maximize preferences if the resulting outcome is among each individual’s most 
preferred options, within the set of outcomes that he or she can generate through 
unilateral deviations. This equilibrium notion admits a straightforward behavioral 

2 First identified by Huber, Payne, and Puto (1982), it has been documented since then in various empirical and 
experimental settings: see references in Ok, Ortoleva, and Riella (2011, footnotes 2 and 3).

3 Such choice pattern is consistent with k = 1, a long-term goal which ranks the salad above the pizza slice, in 
turn above the burger, and an opposite short-term goal.

4 This interpretation motivated Hurwicz’s (1986) work, a discussion of which is available at the end of this 
introduction.



2977de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

extension, replacing “most preferred” by “chosen.” An equilibrium in this sense 
will still be referred to as a Nash equilibrium. Formal definitions are provided in 
Section I and are illustrated in Section II, with two examples of implementation: one 
(as in (a) above) where individuals may be subject to an attraction effect, and one 
(as in (b) above) where individuals have limited willpower to exercise self-control.

Section III provides necessary and sufficient conditions for Nash implementabil-
ity, which extends Maskin’s (1999) classic result5 from domains containing only 
choice correspondences which are consistent with preference maximization to any 
domain of choice correspondences. These conditions prove useful to delineate the 
limits of implementation in any application, but as for Maskin monotonicity, more 
work is usually needed to identify some or all implementable SCRs in each given 
problem. This paper is dedicated to the study of implementable extensions of the 
Pareto SCR. Additional practical implications of the general necessary and suffi-
cient conditions are provided in de Clippel (2012).6

Pareto efficiency provides a classic example of SCR that is Nash implementable 
in the standard framework. How does Pareto’s concept extend beyond the rational 
domain? Which extensions, if any, remain Nash implementable? Section IV applies 
the general results derived in Section III to provide sharp answers. There exist mul-
tiple extensions of the Pareto SCR which are Nash implementable on all domains. 
Interestingly, there exists a maximal implementable extension of the Pareto SCR, 
which can be characterized in simple terms: an option x is efficient in this sense if 
one can find implicit opportunity sets, one for each individual, such that (i) all indi-
viduals would pick x out of their respective opportunity sets, and (ii) all options are 
accounted for, in the sense that each alternative to x belongs to the opportunity set of 
at least one individual. Similar properties on opportunity sets were introduced inde-
pendently by Sugden (2004) in economic environments with private consumption, 
under the name of “opportunity criterion.” The maximal implementable extension 
always refines, sometimes strictly, Bernheim and Rangel’s (2009) extended notion 
of efficiency. There also exists a minimal implementable extension, which happens 
to be a simple variant of its maximal counterpart, where implicit opportunity sets 
are essentially disjoint. Finally, I show that a social planner may sometimes design a 
mechanism to guarantee Pareto efficiency when individuals maximize preferences, 
but imperfectly so: for instance, when individuals may be prone to mistakes when 
being overwhelmed by too many options (see Iyengar and Kamenica 2010 and some 
references therein).

Section V is dedicated to Shapley and Scarf’s (1974) housing market, which cap-
tures some key features of matching problems and exchange economies. I character-
ize both the maximal and a nearly minimal implementable extension of the strong 
Pareto SCR. In exchange economies, aggregate demand functions emanate from 
individual choices from budget sets. The concept of competitive equilibrium can 

5 The paper circulated as a working paper from 1977 and 1998. Surveys on the large literature on implementation 
theory include Maskin (1985); Moore (1992); Palfrey (1992, 2002); Corchón (1996); Jackson (2001); Maskin and 
Sjöström (2002); and Serrano (2004).

6 In particular, de Clippel (2012) touches upon an important direction for future research, namely to understand 
what the general necessary and sufficient conditions imply in applications where individuals are subject to specific 
forms of biases. New implementable SCRs are identified for instance for classes of order-dependent choices. A 
notion of rich domain is also introduced in the paper, which allows to extend classic impossibility results.

thus be defined without relying on preferences (see Sugden 2004 and Bernheim and 
Rangel 2009 among others). I show that a competitive equilibrium exists in housing 
markets, independently of the individuals’ choice functions. We will see that imple-
mentable extensions of Pareto play a key role in extending the two fundamental 
theorems of welfare economics. Finally, taking property rights into account raises 
the question of coalitional deviations and in particular of individual rationality in 
the absence of preferences. I show that the strong core also admits a maximal imple-
mentable extension, which corresponds to a simple refinement of Sugden’s (2004) 
opportunity criterion. More importantly, competitive allocations belong to this 
extended core, which refines the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics.

The analysis throughout the paper highlights the key role of “opportunity sets” 
when taking individual choices instead of preferences as exogenous variables. 
Opportunity sets capture what is available to an individual in various circumstances. 
They take the form of budget sets in the case of a competitive equilibrium, capture 
the set of outcomes an individual can generate through unilateral deviations in case 
of a Nash equilibrium, or represent the set of objects which remain available after 
higher priority individuals have made their pick in serial dictatorship procedures. 
The classic property of Maskin monotonicity extends into a general necessary con-
dition for Nash implementability which requires finding opportunity sets which are 
consistent with the SCR. It then follows that implementable extensions of Pareto 
efficiency (or the core) must themselves be defined in terms of implicit opportunity 
sets, which is the route that Sugden (2004) already followed, but for independent, 
normative reasons.

Related Literature.—The importance of taking behavioral biases into account 
when designing mechanisms is attracting attention in the popular press, especially 
since Thaler and Sunstein’s (2008) book Nudge. This interest is also apparent in 
the academic literature, with an effort to adapt models in industrial organization 
to determine the best contracts that a monopolist or competing firms can offer to 
maximize their profits when customers are subject to specific choice biases (see 
Spiegler 2011 for a synthesis). The present paper extends implementation theory to 
problems where individual choices may be inconsistent with the maximization of a 
context-independent preference, motivated by recent developments in the theories 
of choice and welfare.

Proposition 2, which offers necessary and sufficient conditions for Nash imple-
mentability, is the only result in this paper which has some precedence in the lit-
erature. Inspired by implementation problems where a mechanism designer tries to 
elicit information from groups, Hurwicz (1986) shows how Maskin’s (1999) classic 
results extend to the case where individual choice correspondences select the set of 
options which are undominated for some binary relation. By contrast, my analysis 
accommodates any form of individual behavior, which is important in view of the 
many varied choice patterns that may occur under bounded rationality. To illustrate 
the limits of Hurwicz’s approach, notice that a choice correspondence is single-
valued in his framework only if it is rational. Korpela (2012)7 (see also, Ray 2010)

studied independently the question of characterizing Nash implementability with 
no restriction on individual choices. I will explain in Section III the similarities and 
differences of Proposition 2 with these other results.

A few other relevant references include: Eliaz (2002), who studies full implemen-
tation in Nash equilibrium which is robust to the presence of any number of “faulty” 
individuals below a fixed threshold, where faulty individuals may behave in any 
possible way; Cabrales and Serrano (2011), who investigate implementation prob-
lems under the behavioral assumption that agents adjust myopically their actions in 
the direction of better responses or best responses; Saran (2011), who studies under 
which conditions over individual choice correspondences over savage acts does the 
revelation principle hold for partial Nash implementation with incomplete informa-
tion; Glazer and Rubinstein (2012), who introduce a mechanism design model in 
which both the content and framing of the mechanism affect the agent’s ability to 
manipulate the information he provides; and Bierbrauer and Netzer (2012), who 
study a first model of partial Bayesian implementation with intentions.

I. Definitions

Consider a set  of individuals who must select an option from a set . It is 
assumed throughout the paper that there are at least three individuals, except when 
discussing the case of two individuals at the end of Section III. Each individual i ’s 
choice behavior is captured by a choice correspondence which may vary with a 
state. Formally, i ’s choice correspondence given a state θ selects a nonempty subset, 
denoted  C i (, θ), of each choice problem  ⊆ . The set of all relevant states is 
denoted Θ. Information is complete, meaning that the state is common knowledge 
among individuals (but of course unknown to the mechanism designer).

Individual i ’s choice correspondence is rational at θ if there exists a complete 
transitive preference ⪰ such that C(, θ) = arg ma x ⪰  , for each subset  of . 
As is well known, a choice correspondence is rational if and only if it satisfies 
Sen’s (1971) properties α ("Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives," or IIA) and  
β (“Expansion”). Rational choice correspondences are single-valued (in which case 
rationality is equivalent to IIA) when preferences are strict.

A social choice rule (SCR) is a correspondence f ∶ Θ →  which selects a non-
empty subset of options for each state. A mechanism is a collection ((  i  ) i∈ , μ), 
where   i  is the set of messages available to i, and μ ∶  →  is the outcome 
function (with  =   1  × ⋯ ×   i ).

A strategy for individual i is the choice of a message in   i . Under rationality, a 
strategy profile forms a Nash equilibrium if the resulting outcome is most preferred 
for each individual within the set of options he or she can generate through unilateral 
deviations: that is, by varying his or her own strategy while others play their part of 
the equilibrium. This definition admits a straightforward extension to games involv-
ing individual choice correspondences which cannot be explained by the maximiza-
tion of a well-behaved preference: for each individual, the equilibrium outcome is 
among the chosen options within the set of outcomes he or she can generate through 
unilateral deviations.

Formally, individual i ’s opportunity set given a strategy profile  m −i  for the other 
individuals is given by  O i ( m −i ) = {μ( m i  ,  m −i ) |  m i  ∈   i } ⊆ . Then a strategy 



2980 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

 profile ( m  i  ∗ (θ) ) i∈  forms a Nash equilibrium of the game induced by the mecha-
nism (, μ) at a state θ if μ( m ∗ (θ)) ∈  C i ( O i ( m  −i  ∗  (θ)), θ), for all i ∈ . The mecha-
nism (, μ) implements the SCR f in Nash equilibrium if f (θ) = { μ( m ∗ (θ)) |  m ∗ (θ)  
is a Nash equilibrium at θ}, for all θ ∈ Θ. The SCR f is then said to be Nash 
implementable.

Individuals’ choices are thus assumed to depend only on the set of options avail-
able to them. This rules out other, more general forms of bounded rationality where 
individual choices may vary for instance with the number of times an option appears 
in an opportunity set, the order in which messages are presented in the defini-
tion of the mechanism, or the very phrasing of messages in a common language. 
Incorporating these features provides an interesting direction for future research.

A. Building Willpower in Groups

Temptation is often understood in economics through the lens of commitment pref-
erences (see Lipman and Pesendorfer 2013 for a survey). An individual who antici-
pates having to fight temptation at the time of making a choice may want to commit 
to a smaller set of options. By contrast, the focus in the psychology literature is often 
on individuals who make choices while being tempted, and how they deplete their 
willpower when exercising self-control (see, e.g., Baumeister and Tierney 2011).8

Here is a stylized model of choice which captures temptation, self-control, and 
willpower in a way that is closer to the psychology literature. There are n individu-
als with a common long-term goal. This long-term goal is difficult to achieve due 
to the presence of tempting alternatives: choices are also influenced by a short-term 
craving. Each individual has some limited willpower to exercise self-control. In this 
example, willpower is captured by the number of tempting options an individual can 
overlook to better fulfill his long-term goal. Formally, given an ordering  ≻ L  on  
capturing the long-term goal, an ordering  ≻ S  on  capturing the short-term craving, 
and an integer  k i  capturing i ’s willpower, i ’s choice out of any  ⊆  is the  most 
preferred element for  ≻ L  among those that are dominated by at most  k i  alternatives 
according to  ≻ S  . Such behavior leads typically to violations of IIA. For instance, 
one may be able to resist eating a slice of pizza for lunch when the alternative is a 
salad, but unable to resist the temptation of both the burger and the pizza slice, going 
for the slice if these two options are available on the menu in addition to the salad. 
This choice pattern can be explained with  k i  = 1, salad  ≻ L  pizza slice  ≻ L  burger, and 
burger  ≻ S  pizza slice  ≻ S  salad.

Consider now a situation where a state determines a common long-term goal, 
and the individuals’ (possibly different) short-term cravings. Is there a way to com-
bine the individuals’ limited willpower to help them better fulfill their common 
 long-term goal? One idea is to decentralize the burden of choice by letting each 

8 First attempts to capture willpower in economics include Ozdenoren, Salant, and Silverman (2012), who study 
the optimal management of willpower over time; and Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozdenoren (2011), who study 
commitment preferences for individuals who anticipate having to fight temptation with limited willpower when 
having to make a choice.



2981de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

individual be “in charge of ” only a small number of alternatives. Here is a simple 
mechanism to achieve this. Let   i  ⊂  be the subset of  k i  elements that individual 
i will be in charge of. Let’s assume that  ∑  i∈  

 
    k i  ≥ #, so that these subsets can be 

chosen so as to cover : that is  =  ∪ i∈    i  . Each individual picks a message in sup-
port of one of the elements he is in charge of, as well as a nonnegative integer repre-
senting the intensity with which he makes that statement. Formally,   i  =   i  ×  핑 +  . 
The outcome is the option supported by the individual with the most intense report 
(using any fixed tie-breaking rule if multiple messages are reported with the highest 
intensity).

The mechanism has the property that, for any message profile, individual i can gen-
erate at most  k i  + 1 options when varying his own message, out of which he picks the 
option that is best for his long-term goal. Clearly, the option which is top ranked in 
 for the long-term goal is an equilibrium outcome of this mechanism (e.g., with the 
individual in charge of it suggesting it with intensity 1 and all other individuals sup-
porting other options with intensity 0). Conversely, any Nash equilibrium outcome 
must be the best element in  for the long-term goal. Otherwise, the individual in 
charge of it will deviate by supporting it in a message whose intensity is larger than 
the messages from all other individuals. We have thus proved the following result.

PROPOSITION 1: If   ∑  i∈  
 
    k i  ≥ #, then the SCR which selects systematically the 

top-choice of the common long-term goal is Nash implementable.

The result assumes that the mechanism designer knows each individual’s will-
power index. More generally, willpower indices could vary with the state. Clearly, 
Proposition 1 remains valid provided the assumption  ∑  i∈  

 
    k i  ≥ # holds with  k i  as 

the minimum of i′ ’s willpower index over all states.

B. Hiring with Attraction Effect

Remember the problem of hiring with attraction effect described in (A) in the 
introduction. Formally, the set  of options is {x, y, z,  x ∗ ,  y ∗ ,  z ∗ , nh}, where “nh” 
stands for “not hiring,” while the set of states is Θ = ( × {0, 1} )  , where  is the 
set of strict preferences on  that rank any of x, y, z above nh, and nh above any 
of  x ∗ ,  y ∗ ,  z ∗ . Indices 1 or 0 capture whether the corresponding individual is subject 
to the attraction effect, or not. Having  θ i  = (≻, 0) means that individual i is ratio-
nal and maximizes ≻ at θ. If  θ i  = (≻, 1) instead, then individual i is subject to the 
attraction effect, and in particular, picks x out of {x,  x ∗ , y, z, nh}, y out of {x, y,  y ∗ ,  
z, nh}, and z out of {x, y, z,  z ∗ , nh}.

Now fix two individuals, say i and j, and consider the following mechanism:  
 i  = {x, y, z, j,  j   ∗ },   j  = {x, y, z}, with the outcome function μ (which depends 
only on i and j ’s messages) defined as follows:

μ x y z

   .

x nh x x
y y nh y
z z z nh
j x y z
 j ∗  x ∗  y ∗  z ∗ 



2982 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

Individual i ’s opportunity set given any message from j contains x, y, z, nh and 
one of  x ∗ ,  y ∗ ,  z ∗ . If  θ i  = (≻, 0), a case in which i is rational, then the equilibrium 
outcome must be ≻-maximal on . If  θ i  = (≻, 1) instead, a case in which individual 
i is subject to the attraction effect, then “j  ” is the only message for i that can be part 
of a Nash equilibrium, as it is the only message which gives i the option a in the 
 column where  a ∗  is available in his opportunity set. Individual j ’s opportunity set 
given this message is {x, y, z}. Hence the equilibrium outcome must be j ’s most 
preferred option among {x, y, z}.

It is immediate to check, conversely, that the candidate equilibrium outcomes 
we have identified as a function of θ are indeed supported by equilibrium strate-
gies. We have thus identified a mechanism which implements the social choice rule  
f ij  that picks i ’s most preferred option when i is rational, and picks j ’s top choice 
within {x, y, z} when i is subject to the attraction effect. Interestingly, the domain is 
rich to the extent that it contains all profiles of individual choice correspondences 
associated to the maximization of some strict preference over {x, y, z}, the range 
of  f ij  . With such a rich domain, a SCR which is implementable via a mechanism 
which relies on messages from only two rational individuals must be dictatorial (see 
Jackson and Srivastava 1992). We see that such a result does not extend beyond the 
rational domain, as the outcome picked by  f ij  varies with the reports of both i and j.

III. Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

The previous section provides only two examples of SCRs which are Nash imple-
mentable in two specific applications. It would be useful to have general conditions 
which could help us identify more systematically SCRs which are Nash imple-
mentable in various applications.

Necessary Condition.—I start by providing a necessary condition which extends 
Maskin monotonicity beyond the rational domain. Consider a SCR f ∶ Θ →  which 
is Nash implementable by a mechanism ((  i  ) i∈  , μ). Let then  m ∗  be a Nash equi-
librium at θ whose associated outcome μ( m ∗ ) coincides with an element x of f (θ). 
This strategy profile defines an opportunity set for each individual, call it  O i  , by 
varying his or her own strategy while others play  m  −i  ∗   . By definition of Nash equilib-
rium, it must be that x ∈  C i  ( O i  , θ), for all i. In addition, if there is some alternative 
state  θ′  such that x ∈  C i  ( O i ,  θ′   ) for all i, then clearly  m ∗  forms a Nash equilibrium 
at  θ′  as well. Hence x is an equilibrium outcome at  θ′  and x ∈ f ( θ′   ) if f is Nash 
implementable.

A collection  = { O i  (x, θ) | i ∈ , x ∈ f (θ), θ ∈ Θ} of opportunity sets is consis-
tent with f if

 (i) x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x, θ), θ), for all θ ∈ Θ, all x ∈ f (θ), and all i ∈ ,

 (ii) For all θ,  θ′  and x ∈ f (θ), if x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x, θ),  θ′   ), for all i, then x ∈ f ( θ′   ).

The argument from the previous paragraph illustrates how the existence of a 
consistent collection of opportunity sets must be a necessary condition for Nash 
implementability.



2983de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

PROPOSITION 2A: If a SCR f is Nash implementable, then there exists a collection 
of opportunity sets which is consistent with f.

Consistency with a SCR f requires x to be a chosen alternative for each indi-
vidual out of his or her opportunity set at (x, θ) when the state is θ. In addition, if 
x ∈ f (θ)\ f ( θ′   ), then one must find at least one individual who would not pick x out 
of his or her (x, θ) opportunity set when the state is  θ′ . This is reminiscent of Maskin 
monotonicity for the rational case: if x ∈ f (θ)\ f ( θ′   ), then there exists i and y in x’s 
lower contour set for  ⪰ i  (θ) such that i prefers strictly y over x at  θ′ .

The key distinction is that checking consistency simplifies under rationality: there 
is a collection of opportunity sets which is consistent with f if and only if the collec-
tion of lower contour sets is consistent with f.9 The added complexity of having to 
consider many collections of opportunity sets is the price to pay for the necessary 
condition to be valid independently of any theory of choice. The many applications 
presented in this paper and in de Clippel (2012) show how consistency remains 
nonetheless workable and can provide important insights.

To illustrate consistency, notice how it is satisfied in the examples from Section II: 
for the willpower example, take  O i  (x, θ) =   i  ∪ {x}, where   i  ⊆  is the set of 
options that i is “in charge of  ”; for the hiring example, i ’s opportunity set contains 
x, y, z at all states, in addition to  a ∗ , where a =  f ij  (θ), if i is subject to the attraction 
effect at θ, and  a ∗ , for some a ≠  f ij  (θ), if i is rational at θ, while j ’s opportunity set is 
{x, y, z} at states where i is subject to the attraction effect (all other opportunity sets 
contain only the option picked by  f ij ).

Sufficient Condition.—The existence of a collection of opportunity sets which is 
consistent with a SCR does not guarantee its implementability. For instance, it is 
well known under rationality that an implementable SCR with a full range must pick 
alternatives which are top-ranked by all individuals. In the absence of rationality, 
“top-ranked” can be replaced by “chosen within .” The SCR f respects unanimity 
if x ∈ f (θ) for any x, θ such that x ∈  ∩ i∈   C i  (, θ).

Combining unanimity in this sense with a strengthening of consistency provides 
a useful sufficient condition for implementability. The collection  of opportunity 
sets is strongly consistent with f if it is consistent with f, and x ∈ f (θ), for all x, θ 
for which there exists j,  θ′  and  x′  ∈ f ( θ′   ) such that x ∈  C i  (, θ), for all i ≠ j, and  
x ∈  C j  ( O j  ( x′ ,  θ′   ), θ). The condition distinguishing strong consistency from its plain 
counterpart shares some resemblance with the unanimity property. If a state θ is 
such that all individuals except j include x in their set of choices from , and j 
includes x in his set of choices when facing one of his opportunity sets in the col-
lection , then the SCR must include x at θ. We are now ready to state a partial 
converse to Proposition 2A.

PROPOSITION 2B: If f respects unanimity and there exists a collection of opportu-
nity sets which is strongly consistent with f, then f is Nash implementable.

9 Indeed, the premise of condition 2 in the definition of consistency is harder to meet with larger opportunity sets, 
and opportunity sets cannot be larger than lower contour sets to avoid a contradiction with condition 1.



2984 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

With rationality, this sufficient condition is also necessary for full-range SCRs 
(see Moore and Repullo 1990). This ceases to be the case when accommodating 
bounded rationality. For instance, the full-range SCR which picks the top choice of 
the common long-term goal in Section II is implementable while violating the suf-
ficient condition from Proposition 2B.

While Proposition 2B allows us to prove most results in the rest of the paper, a 
limit to its applicability comes from the fact that strong consistency and unanimity 
involves restrictions on the SCR as a function of what individuals would pick when 
facing  in its entirety. The example from Section II illustrates how SCRs can some-
times be implemented successfully by decentralizing the burden of choice, making 
sure that individuals always face small option sets. The next proposition provides a 
simple alternative sufficient condition which builds on this insight.

PROPOSITION 2B′: If there exists a collection of opportunity sets which is con-
sistent with a SCR f, and there exists (  i  ) i∈  such that x ∈ f (θ) for each x, θ with  
| {i ∈  | x ∈  C i (  i  ∪ {x}, θ)} | ≥ |  | − 2, then f is Nash implementable.

Elements in   i  can be interpreted as outside options. In addition to the neces-
sary condition of consistency, f (θ) is required to contain any alternative which all 
but at most two individuals would pick at θ when it is available in addition to their 
respective outside options. One is free to decide on the content of the sets   i  , which 
in particular may be small. This offers a useful alternative to Proposition 2B (see 
Proposition 6 below, for instance). The sufficient conditions from Propositions 2B 
and 2B′ are not necessary though.10 While their proofs suggest ways to provide finer 
sufficient conditions, I conjecture that a condition which is both necessary and suf-
ficient would be so intricate that it would be of limited help in applications.

Independently of my work, Korpela (2012) studies under which assumptions on 
individual behavior Moore and Repullo’s (1990) conditions remain both necessary 
and sufficient for implementability (for SCRs with or without a full range). While 
always sufficient, necessity is shown to require Sen’s property α. Unfortunately, 
most choice models with bounded rationality violate Sen’s property.11 Korpela’s 
sufficient condition is the same as that of Proposition 2B when considering SCRs 
with a full range, as in most of this paper. Ray (2010) shows that implementability 
implies a choice-based version of Maskin monotonicity.12 It is not difficult to check 
that Ray’s property is satisfied whenever there exists a collection of opportunity sets 
which is consistent with a SCR, and that it is too restrictive to provide the basis for 
a widely applicable sufficient condition (see de Clippel 2012).

Proposition 2A holds also in the case of two individuals. As in Moore and Repullo 
(1990) (see the difference between their conditions μ and μ2; as well as Dutta and 
Sen 1991), an additional necessary condition holds in that case: there exists a func-
tion e which associates an element of  to each x, θ,  x′ ,  θ′  with x ∈ f (θ) and  x′  ∈ f ( θ′   ),  

10 For instance, the SCR which picks the top choice of the common long-term goal in the willpower exam-
ple from Section IIA is implementable but does not satisfy either sufficient conditions when  k i  = 1 for all i and 
|  | = |   | = 3.

11 For instance, it implies rationality for single-valued choice correspondences.
12 This property appeared previously in Aizerman and Aleskerov (1986), who extend Arrow’s impossibility theo-

rem when aggregating arbitrary individual choice correspondences.

such that (i) e(x, θ,  x′ ,  θ′   ) ∈  O 1 (x, θ) ∩  O 2 ( x′ ,  θ′   ), and (ii) e(x, θ,  x′ ,  θ′   ) ∈ f (θ″  ), for 
all θ″ such that e(x, θ,  x′ ,  θ′   ) ∈  C 1 ( O 1 (x, θ), θ″  ) ∩  C 2 ( O 2 ( x′ ,  θ′   ), θ″  ). Remember 
indeed that  O i  (x, θ) corresponds to outcomes which i can reach through unilateral 
deviations when the other individuals play their part of the Nash equilibrium at θ 
in the mechanism that implements f. With only two individuals, columns and rows 
of such outcomes must intersect: hence, the existence of such a function e. It is 
not difficult to check that Proposition 2B applies with two individuals after adding 
this condition. Clearly, Proposition 2B′ applies only when there are three or more 
individuals.

IV. Efficiency

With rational individuals, an option is said to be (weakly) Pareto efficient if there 
is no alternative which is unanimously strictly preferred. The Pareto SCR provides 
a classic example of SCR which is Nash implementable. In this section, I discuss 
possible extensions of the Pareto principle when individual choices need not be con-
sistent with the maximization of a well-behaved preference.

Maximal and Minimal Implementable Extensions.—A SCR f ∶ Θ →   is an exten-
sion of the Pareto SCR if Θ contains all profiles of rational choice correspondences 
and f (θ) coincides with the set of Pareto efficient options when choice correspon-
dences are rational at θ. It is a maximal implementable extension if it is Nash imple-
mentable and contains any implementable extension of the Pareto SCR. It turns out 
that there exist multiple implementable extensions of the Pareto SCR, that there 
exists a maximal implementable extension, which also admits a simple expression 
and is closely related to Sugden’s (2004) opportunity criterion.

Say that an option x is efficient given a profile of individual choice correspon-
dences if one can find a collection of implicit opportunity sets, one for each indi-
vidual, such that all individuals would pick x out of their own implicit opportunity 
sets, and all the options have been accounted for, in the sense that any option in  
belongs to the implicit opportunity set of at least one individual. Formally,

   f   eff  (θ) =  { x ∈    | (∃ (  i  ) i∈  subsets of   ) ∶ x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ),

 for all i, and  =  ∪ i∈    i  }  ,

for each θ ∈ Θ.13

PROPOSITION 3:  f   eff  is Nash implementable on all domains, and is the maximal 
implementable extension of the Pareto SCR.

Sugden (2004, pp. 1016–17) writes: “In normative economics, there is an 
increasing interest in criteria of opportunity rather than of preference  satisfaction. 

13 Notice that  f   eff  has nonempty values, since it contains any option x such that x ∈  C i (, θ), for some i ∈ , 
in the same way that any most preferred alternative of any individual is always Pareto efficient when choices are 
rational.



2986 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

In  opportunity-based theories, value is attached to the size and richness of an 
 individual’s opportunity set—that is, the set of options from which he is free to 
choose.” The use of implicit opportunity sets in the definition of  f   eff  is in line with 
this point of view. In fact, the property imposed on implicit opportunity sets used 
to justify the efficiency of an option is closely related to the opportunity criterion 
proposed by Sugden (2004) for economic environments with private consumption. 
This relation will be made precise in the context of housing markets studied in the 
next section.

Remarkably, there is also a nonempty minimal implementable extension of the 
Pareto SCR, which is a simple, intuitive variant of  f   eff . The only difference is that 
implicit opportunity sets are required to be essentially disjoint. Formally, for each 
θ, let     f    eff (θ) be the set of options x for which one can find a collection (  i  ) i∈  of  
subsets of  such that x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ), for all i,   i  ∩   j  = {x}, for all i ≠ j, and  
 =  ∪ i∈    i  . The process of accounting for all alternatives is now fully “decentral-
ized,” with each individual facing a distinct subset of alternatives to test against 
the option being sustained. Clearly     f    eff  ⊆  f   eff , and     f    eff  has nonempty values.14 The 
SCR     f    eff  is the minimal implementable extension of the Pareto SCR in the sense 
that     f    eff  ⊆ f, for each Nash implementable extension f of the Pareto SCR.

PROPOSITION 4:     f    eff  is Nash implementable on all domains, and is the minimal 
implementable extension of the Pareto SCR.

Bernheim and Rangel’s (2009) Notion of Efficiency.—The question of how to 
extend the Pareto principle beyond the rational domain is being debated in the recent 
literature. Bernheim and Rangel (2009)—henceforth, BR—posit that an option a is 
(strictly) unambiguously preferred to an alternative b given a choice correspondence 
C if b ∉ C(  ), for all  containing a. Though necessarily incomplete when Property 
α is violated, this revealed ordering and the associated Pareto ranking may allow us 
to compare some options. An option is BR-efficient if there is no alternative which 
is unambiguously preferred by all individuals. Let  f  bre  be the SCR that associates to 
each state θ the set of BR-efficient options at θ.

I now show that  f   eff  (and hence any implementable extension of the Pareto SCR) 
is a selection of  f   bre , and that BR-efficient options need not belong to  f   eff . Say that 
a SCR is weakly Nash implementable if it contains a Nash implementable SCR. 
By Proposition 3, we can conclude that  f   bre  is weakly Nash implementable, but not 
Nash implementable.

PROPOSITION 5:  f   eff  ⊆  f   bre , and there exist states θ for which  f   eff (θ) ⊊  f   bre (θ). 
Hence,  f   bre  is weakly Nash implementable, but not Nash implementable.

Weak implementation guarantees that equilibrium outcomes belong systemati-
cally to the SCR, but leaves open the possibility that there may be states at which out-
comes picked by the SCR cannot be achieved at equilibrium. It is thus weaker than 
the notion of (full) implementation introduced in Section I and studied in a majority 

14 Again, any option x such that x ∈  C i (, θ), for some i, belongs to     f     
eff (θ) (simply take   i  =  and   j  = {x}, 

for all j ≠ i  ).



2987de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

of the implementation literature with rational individuals. There are  reasons to pre-
fer full over weak implementability: see, e.g., Thomson (1996). Even so, learning 
that a SCR is weakly implementable is valuable, and may be sufficient to fulfill the 
goal of the mechanism designer in some circumstances.

Pareto Efficiency for “True” Underlying Preferences.—Some models of bounded 
rationality offer structured departures from rationality, with new primitives (e.g., 
consideration sets, or salience ordering) influencing choices in addition to prefer-
ences. In such circumstances, welfare analysis could be conducted in terms of the 
“true” underlying preferences, as suggested, for instance, by Rubinstein and Salant 
(2008, 2012); Manzini and Mariotti (2012); and Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay 
(2012). Is Pareto efficiency in that sense Nash implementable?

To tackle this question, consider choice models where individuals are rational 
when facing small choice problems; let’s say binary problems so as to encompass 
as many choice correspondences as possible. Formally, states are restricted to the 
set  Θ ∗  with the following property: for each θ ∈  Θ ∗ , there exists a preference profile  
( ⪰ i  ) i∈  such that x  ⪰ i  y if and only if x ∈  C i  ({x, y}, θ).

The Pareto SCR  f   par  associates to each θ ∈  Θ ∗  the set of options which are Pareto 
efficient for the unique preference profile defined by pairwise choices at θ. Thinking 
in terms of implicit opportunity sets is helpful to study the implementability of  f   par .  
Consider for instance a state where all individual preferences coincide. Pareto effi-
ciency requires picking the common top element, say x. Suppose however that indi-
viduals do not pick x when facing large choice problems (e.g., they opt for a more 
salient option when overwhelmed by too many options). With only few individuals 
compared to the number of options available, any collection of implicit opportunity 
sets that is consistent with  f   par  (see Proposition 2A) must omit some alternative y. 
By consistency, the SCR must still pick x at states where y Pareto dominates x, 
which means that  f   par  is not implementable when there are only few individuals.

With sufficiently many individuals, however, it is possible to better decentralize 
the burden of choice.15 Consider a selection of     f    eff , where each implicit opportunity 
set   i  used to justify an option x is required to contain at most two elements. The 
condition  =  ∪ i∈    i  then implies that x is Pareto efficient, since individuals are 
rational over binary problems. With sufficiently many individuals, one can show 
that there always exists at least one Pareto efficient option x that can be justified via 
binary implicit opportunity sets, and that the variant of     f    eff  is Nash implementable, 
which means that  f   par  is weakly Nash implementable. Even with many individuals, 
not all Pareto efficient options can be obtained this way, and  f   par  as a whole is not 
implementable.

PROPOSITION 6: If |  | ≥ 3|   |, then  f   par  is weakly Nash implementable. On the 
other hand,  f   par  is not Nash implementable, whatever the number of individuals, and 
no selection of  f   par  is Nash implementable if |  | ≤ |   | − 2.

15 A similar idea already proved useful to establish Proposition 1.



2988 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

Illustration.—To better grasp what differentiates the concepts discussed in 
this section, consider three individuals,  = {1, 2, 3}, who pick options from 
 = {a, b, … , z}. In all scenarios below, each individual’s choices are among the 
top two feasible elements for some underlying preference.

In a first scenario, all three individuals have the same alphabetical preference 
a ≻ b ≻ ⋯ ≻ z. While the first individual systematically maximizes that ordering, 
the other two pick systematically the second best option (a choice procedure first 
studied by Baigent and Gaertner 1996, and further discussed in Kalai, Rubinstein, 
and Spiegler 2002). All options are BR-efficient; options other than a are not unam-
biguously dominated by any alternative for individuals 2 and 3, and a is not unam-
biguously dominated by any alternative for the first individual. The SCR  f   par  is 
applicable to the extent that pairwise choices of all three individuals appear transi-
tive. However, the concept is meaningful only if one believes that individuals maxi-
mize preferences in pairwise choices, which contradicts the story of how choices 
emerge in this scenario. Applying  f   par  gives  in its entirety as for BR-efficiency, 
since the pairwise choices of the first individual are always different from those of 
the other two individuals. The SCRs  f   eff  and     f    eff  happen to coincide, both selecting 
{a, b, c}.16

In a second scenario, the first individual also picks the second best option for 
the alphabetical order. BR-efficiency now selects   \{a},  f   par  selects {z}, while  f   eff  
and     f    eff  both select {b, c, d}.

More generally, if the three individuals’ choices always belong to the top two 
elements of underlying preferences, then for each option selected by  f   eff   ( and a for-
tiori     f    eff    ) , it is impossible to find more than three alternatives which Pareto domi-
nate it for these underlying preferences, thus never picking an option that is too 
inefficient.

To find a case where  f   eff  and     f    eff  differ, suppose that all three individuals maximize 
the common alphabetical preference in all problems containing less than 20 ele-
ments, but may happen to make a small mistake, picking at worst the  second best 
option, when facing larger sets. Suppose in particular that c is picked both out of 
{a, c, d, … , z} and out of {b, c, d, … , z}. In this scenario, c belongs to  f   eff , using the 
implicit opportunity sets   1  = {c},   2  = {a, c, d, … , z}, and   3  = {b, c, d, … , z}, 
but not to     f    eff .17

V. Housing Markets

Results from Section III are now applied to Shapley and Scarf’s (1974) housing 
market, which captures key features of exchange economies and matching prob-
lems. Individuals each own one indivisible object  h  i  ∗ , their initial endowment. The 

16 Indeed, a is picked by the first individual out of , b is picked by the second individual out of , and implicit 
opportunity sets supporting c are   1  = {c, d, … , z},   2  = {a, c} and   3  = {b, c}. However, there is no way to find 
implicit opportunity sets supporting options d to z, as they are dominated in the common underlying ordering by 
more than two options.

17 To support c, at least one implicit opportunity set must contain a, c, and at least 18 other elements different 
from b, while another implicit opportunity set must contain b, c, and at least 18 other elements different from a. 
These two implicit opportunity sets will have to contain a common option other than c, which is incompatible with 
c ∈     f    eff .



2989de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

set of all available objects is given by  = { h  i  ∗  | i ∈  }, while the set of allocations 
achievable through trade is given by  = {x ∈     |  x i  ≠  x j  , ∀i ≠ j }.

In most matching models, preferences over objects are strict, and individuals care 
only about their own consumption. I follow the same methodology, but without 
requiring individuals to be rational. For each  ⊆ , let   i  be the set of objects 
that accrue to i in the different elements of . At each θ, individual i ’s choices 
among objects are captured by a function  γ i  (·, θ) ∶ P() → , where P() is the 
set of subsets of . His choice correspondence over allocations is then given by:  
 C i  (, θ) = {x ∈  |  x i  =  γ i  (  i  , θ)}, for each  ⊆ .

Efficiency.—The SCR  f   eff  identified in the previous section admits an equivalent 
formulation in terms of opportunity sets of objects instead of opportunity sets of 
allocations: an object allocation x ∈  belongs to  f   eff (θ) if and only if18 there exists 
a collection (  i  ) i∈  of subsets of objects such that (i)  x i  =  γ i  (  i  , θ), for each i ∈ , 
and (ii) for each allocation y ∈  there exists at least one individual j for which   j  
contains  y j  .

Any allocation x for which  γ i  (, θ) =  x i  for some i belongs to  f   eff . Yet, there 
might be two rational individuals j and k who would be better off by consuming  x k  
and  x j  respectively. Under rationality, an option is strongly Pareto efficient if there is 
no alternative which leaves everyone at least as well off, and makes someone strictly 
better off. Interestingly, Proposition 3 admits an analogue for strong Pareto in housing 
markets.19 Say that an allocation x ∈  belongs to  f   s.eff (θ) if there exists a sequence  
(  i  ) i∈  of subsets of objects such that (i)  x i  =  γ i (   i  , θ), for each i ∈ , and (ii) for 
each allocation y ∈   \{x} there exists at least one individual j for which   j \{ x j } con-
tains  y j  . Observe that condition (ii), interpreted as a property of the collection (  i  ) i∈  
of opportunity sets, is precisely Sugden’s (2004) “Opportunity Criterion.”

PROPOSITION 7:  f   s.eff  is the maximal implementable extension of the strong 
Pareto SCR.

It remains unknown whether strong Pareto admits a minimal implementable 
extension. However, I can propose an implementable extension which is close to 
being minimal. Let π ∶  → {1, … , n} be an enumeration of the individuals, and 
Π be the set of all such enumerations. The serial dictatorship SCR associated 
to π, denoted  f  π , is defined by induction: for each k, individual j with π( j) = k 
receives the object  γ j  ( \  k  , θ), where   k  is the set of objects allocated to indi-
viduals who precede j in the enumeration. Hence, j is effectively free to choose 
from an opportunity set whose content is given by his rank and what individuals 
with lower rank pick. Let then  f   SD  be the SCR obtained by considering all  possible 

18 If the original definition is satisfied with the collection (  i  ) i∈  of subsets of , then the new definition is satis-
fied with   i  = {  y i  | y ∈   i }, for each i ∈ . Conversely, if the new definition is satisfied with the collection (  i  ) i∈  of 
subsets of , then the original definition is satisfied with   i  = { y |  y i  ∈   i }, for each i ∈ .

19 As is well known, the strong Pareto SCR is not always Nash implementable. This is why its extensions were 
not discussed in the general framework of the previous section. However, implementability does prevail in housing 
markets if individuals have strict preferences (with individual i being indifferent between two allocations x and y 
if and only if  x i  =  y i ).



2990 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

enumerations π,  f   SD (θ) =  ∪ π∈Π    f   π (θ), and     f    
s.eff  be the SCR defined by:     f    s.eff (θ)  

=  f   SD (θ) ∪ {x ∈  | ∃ j, ∀i ≠ j ∶  γ i  (, θ) =  x i }.

PROPOSITION 8:     f    s.eff  is Nash implementable. If f is an implementable extension of 
the strong Pareto SCR, then  f   SD  ⊆ f.

Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics.—The notion of competitive equi-
librium is another central concept in economic environments with property rights. 
Opportunity sets play a key role in its definition, making it easy to extend the con-
cept beyond rational choice. Suppose that objects’ prices are given by p ∈  핉  +   . By 
selling his or her endowment, i enjoys an income $p( h  i  ∗ ); he or she can afford any 
object whose price is lower or equal to p( h  i  ∗ ). Denote by  B i  ( p) the corresponding 
budget set:  B i  ( p) = {h ∈  | p(h) ≤ p( h  i  ∗ )}. If the state is θ, then he or she picks  
 γ i  ( B i  ( p), θ). A price vector p is a competitive equilibrium if supply equals demand: 
that is, for each object h there exists a unique individual i who picks h out of his 
or her budget set. An allocation is competitive if there is a competitive equilibrium 
inducing it.

The same equilibrium notion was introduced and studied by Sugden (2004) and 
Bernheim and Rangel (2009) in economies with divisible goods. The focus on 
housing markets allows us to provide a first existence result. Remarkably, existence 
holds independently of the individuals’ choice behavior. With rational individuals, 
the (unique) competitive allocation can be found via Shapley and Scarf’s (1974) 
top trading cycle procedure. Dropping rationality, I prove in the Appendix that com-
petitive allocations coincide with the outcome of an extended trading cycle proce-
dure. Existence of a competitive equilibrium will follow, but multiplicity is now a 
possibility.

PROPOSITION 9: There is at least one competitive allocation, sometimes more.

The next proposition provides an extension of the two fundamental theorems of 
welfare economics beyond the rational domain.

PROPOSITION 10: (i  ) Competitive allocations at θ belong to  f   s.eff (θ), but need not 
belong to other (smaller) implementable extensions of strong Pareto. (ii  ) Any ele-
ment of     f    s.eff (θ) is competitive at θ for some endowment. The result need not hold for 
other (larger) implementable extensions of strong Pareto.

If individuals are rational at θ, then  f   s.eff (θ) =     f    s.eff (θ), and Proposition 10 indeed 
boils down to the well-known theorems of welfare economics.

Some previous attempts at extending the first theorem of welfare economics to 
encompass bounded rationality can be found in the literature. Sugden (2004) proved 
with divisible goods that any collection of opportunity sets which is market compat-
ible must satisfy his opportunity criterion. Proposition 10 (i) provides an analogue 
for housing markets, phrased in terms of allocations instead of opportunity sets. 
Bernheim and Rangel (2009) prove that any behavioral equilibrium is BR-efficient. 
Proposition 10(i) refines this result for housing markets since BR efficiency is more 
permissive than  f   s.eff .



2991de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

Individual Rationality and the Core.—Pareto efficiency is desirable, but satis-
fying it is not sufficient for a trading mechanism such as competitive markets to 
be judged appealing. For instance, serial dictatorship selects outcomes which are 
Pareto efficient, but need not respect property rights. As illustration, some rational 
 individual may end up consuming an object which is worse than his endowment. 
Fortunately, competitive allocations are not only Pareto efficient, but also individu-
ally rational, and even belong to the strong core; it is impossible to make all the 
members of a coalition weakly better off and at least one of them is strictly better 
off by reallocating their initial endowments.

The following proposition characterizes the largest implementable extension of 
the strong core, shows that it is always nonempty, and refines the first fundamen-
tal theorem of welfare economics from Proposition 10(i). For each coalition , let 
 (  ) be the set of object allocations that can be achieved by its members, that is, 
the set of α ∈      such that { α i  | i ∈   } = { h  i  ∗  | i ∈   } and  α i  ≠  α j  for i ≠ j. Say that 
an allocation x belongs to  f   s.core (θ) if there exists a collection (  i  ) i∈  of subsets 
of objects such that (i)  x i  =  γ i  (  i  , θ), for each i ∈ , and (ii) for each coalition  
and each allocation y ∈  (  )\{ x  } there exists at least one individual j for which  
  j \{ x j } contains  y j  .

PROPOSITION 11:  f   s.core  is the maximal implementable extension of the strong 
core, it contains competitive allocations, and has thus nonempty values.

Condition (ii) in the definition of  f   s.core  boils down to condition (ii) in the defini-
tion of  f   s.eff  when  = . Hence  f   s.core  ⊆  f   s.eff . Individual rationality constraints are 
captured by considering singleton   ’s. It is instructive to see what these conditions 
become in presence of general choice functions. Condition (ii) for  = {i } amounts 
to  h  i  ∗  ∈   i  . In other words, initial endowments must belong to the implicit opportu-
nity sets used to justify an allocation, and property rights translate into the require-
ment that individuals must have the freedom to pick their endowment if they wish to.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2B:
Consider a canonical mechanism as in Maskin (1999) or Moore and Repullo 

(1990):   i  =  × Θ ×  핑 +  , for each i ∈ , with the outcome function μ defined 
as follows:

 (i) If x ∈ f (θ) and  m i  = (x, θ, 0) for each i, then μ(m) = x.

 (ii) If there is j ∈  and x ∈ f (θ) such that  m i  = (x, θ, 0), for each i ∈   \{  j}, and  
m j  = ( x′ ,  θ′ , α) with ( x′ ,  θ′ , α) ≠ (x, θ, 0), then μ(m) =  x′  if  x′  ∈  O j  (x, θ), 
and μ(m) = x otherwise.

 (iii) In all other cases, μ(m) = x, where x is the first component in the report of the 
individual with the lowest index among those who submit the highest integer.

To show that this mechanism implements f, observe that the set of options which i 
can generate through unilateral deviations is  O i  (x, θ) if  m j  = (x, θ, 0) with x ∈ f (θ), 
for all j ≠ i, and is  otherwise. The first condition of consistency of  with f 
implies that, for each x ∈ f (θ), the strategy profile  m x (θ) = (x, θ, 0) forms a Nash 
equilibrium of the game induced by (, μ) at θ. The equilibrium outcome is x. 
Consider now an equilibrium m at θ″ whose associated outcome is y. It remains to 
show that y ∈ f (θ″  ). This follows from the second condition of consistency if m sat-
isfies the requirements in part (i) in the definition of μ, from the definition of strong 
consistency if m satisfies the requirements in part (ii) in the definition of μ, and from 
unanimity if m satisfies the requirements in part (iii) in the definition of μ.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2B′:
Consider a variant of mechanism from Proposition 2B:   i  =  × Θ ×  핑 +  ×   i  ,  

for each i ∈ , with the outcome function defined as follows:

 (i) If x ∈ f (θ) and  m i  = (x, θ, 0, ·) for each i, then μ(m) = x.

 (ii) If there is j ∈  and x ∈ f (θ) such that  m i  = (x, θ, 0, ·), for each i ∈   \{ j},  
and  m j   =  ( x′ ,  θ′ , α, ·) with ( x′ ,  θ′ , α)  ≠  (x, θ, 0), then μ(m)  =   x′  if  
 x′  ∈  O j  (x, θ), and μ(m) = x otherwise.

 (iii) In all other cases, μ(m) =  x i , where  x i  is the fourth component in the report 
of the individual i with the lowest index among those who submit the highest 
integer.

The difference with the mechanism from the proof of Proposition 2B is thus that 
each individual i includes an element of   i  in his message, which becomes relevant 
in part (iii) of the mechanism. As in the proof of Proposition 2B, the fact that  
is consistent with f implies that x is a Nash equilibrium outcome at θ, for each 
x ∈ f (θ), and that any outcome associated to a Nash equilibrium at  θ′  that satisfies 
the requirements in part (i) in the definition of the modified mechanism belongs to 
f ( θ′   ). Suppose next that m is a Nash equilibrium at θ″ satisfying the requirements 
of parts (ii) or (iii), resulting in an outcome y. It is easy to check that there are at 
least |   | − 2 individuals k such that the set of outcomes they can generate through 
unilateral deviations is   k  ∪ { y}, and y ∈  C i  (  k  ∪ { y}, θ″  ) by definition of Nash 
equilibrium. Hence y ∈ f (θ) and f is implementable, as desired.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 3:
By definition, one can associate to any x ∈  f   eff (θ) a collection (    i  x, θ    ) i∈  of subsets 

of  such that x ∈  C i  (    i  x, θ , θ), for each i ∈ , and  =  ∪ i∈      i  x, θ . Then the collec-
tion  = {    i  x, θ  | i ∈ , x ∈  f   eff (θ), θ ∈ Θ} of opportunity sets is consistent with  f   eff . 
Strong consistency of  with  f   eff  and the fact that  f   eff  respects unanimity follow from 
the fact that  f   eff (θ) includes any x such that x ∈  C i  (, θ), for some i ∈ . Hence  f   eff  
is Nash implementable, by Proposition 2B.

To show that  f   eff  extends the Pareto SCR, suppose that individual choice cor-
respondences are rational at θ. If x is Pareto efficient, then it is easy to check that  
x ∈  f   eff (θ) by taking   i  as the lower contour set of x for i. Conversely, suppose that 



2993de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

the collection (  i  ) i∈  of implicit opportunity sets justify why x ∈  f   eff (θ). For any 
element y of , there exists i such that y ∈   i  , since  =  ∪ i    i  , and hence y is in the 
lower contour set of x for i, since x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ). This proves that x is Pareto efficient.

I can now show that  f   eff  is the maximal implementable extension of the Pareto 
SCR. Suppose instead that there exists a Nash implementable extension f of the 
Pareto SCR, a state θ, and an option x ∈ f (θ)\   f   eff (θ). By Proposition 2A, let  be a 
collection of opportunity sets which is consistent with f. Since x ∉  f   eff (θ), there must 
exist y ∈   \ ∪ i∈   O i  (x, θ). Consider then any state  θ′  where all individuals maximize 
a preference which ranks y as the unique top best option, and x as the unique sec-
ond best option. Notice that  C i  ( O i  (x, θ),  θ′   ) = x, for all i, and hence x ∈ f ( θ′   ). This 
contradicts the fact that f extends the Pareto SCR, since x is not Pareto efficient at  θ′ .

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 4:
The proof that     f    eff  is Nash implementable on all domains is similar to that of 

Proposition 3, and is left to the reader (remember in particular footnote 14 when 
checking unanimity and strong consistency).

I now check that     f    eff  extends the Pareto SCR. Suppose that individual choice cor-
respondences are rational at θ. If x is Pareto efficient, then it is easy to check that 
x ∈     f    eff  (θ) by taking   i  = {x} ∪    i  ′  , where    i  ′  is the lower contour set of x for i minus 
the union over j < i of the lower contour sets of x for j. Conversely, if x ∈     f    eff  (θ) ⊆  
f  eff  (θ), then it is Pareto efficient by Proposition 3.

Finally, let f be a Nash implementable extension of the Pareto SCR. I show 
that     f   eff  ⊆ f. Let (  i  ) i∈  be a collection of implicit opportunity sets which justifies why 
x ∈     f    eff  (θ). Let then  θ′  be a state where each individual i is rational, ranking x strictly  
above all other elements of   i  , and strictly below all elements of   \   i  . Since  
 =  ∪ i∈    i  , x is Pareto efficient at  θ′ , and x ∈ f ( θ′   ). By Proposition 2A, let  be a 
collection of opportunity sets which is consistent with f. In particular,  O i  (x,  θ′   ) ⊆   i  ,  
for each i. Suppose now that there exists an individual i and an option z ∈   i \ O i (x,  θ′   ).  
Since   i  ∩   j  = {x}, there is no individual j such that z ∈  O j  (x,  θ′   ). Consider then a 
state θ″ which differs from  θ′  only in that z is the unique top-best option for all indi-
viduals. We have  C j  ( O j  (x,  θ′   ), θ″  ) = {x}, for each j, and hence x ∈ f (θ″  ), a contradic-
tion since f coincides with the Pareto SCR at θ″ while z Pareto dominates x at θ″. To 
avoid this contradiction, it must be that  O i  (x,  θ′   ) =   i  , for each i. Since x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ), 
for all i, it follows that x ∈ f (θ), as desired.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 5:
To show that any option x ∈  f   eff (θ) is BR-efficient at θ, let (  i  ) i∈  be a collection 

of implicit opportunity sets justifying why x ∈  f   eff (θ). For each alternative y, there 
exists i such that y ∈   i  , since  =  ∪ i∈    i  . Hence y does not dominate unambigu-
ously x for i, given that x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ), and x is thus BR-efficient.

Next I show that BR-efficient options need not belong to  f   eff . Start by enumerating 
the elements of  :  = { x 1 , … ,  x K }. Let  C   ∗  be the rational choice correspondence 
which picks systematically the element with smallest index:  C   ∗ (  ) = { x min {k| x k ∈  } },  
for each  ⊆ . Consider a state θ at which  C i  (·, θ) =  C   ∗ ( · ), for each i ≠ 1,  
 C 1 ({ x k ,  x K }, θ) = { x K }, for each k, and  C 1 (, θ) =  C   ∗ (), for all other subsets  of . 
Option  x K  is BR-efficient, since  x K  is not unambiguously dominated by any  alternative 



2994 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

for the first individual (see pairwise choices). However,  x K  ∉  f   eff (θ). Indeed, 
implicit opportunity sets, justifying why x might be efficient, must be the singleton  
{ x K } for individuals other than 1 ( x K  is the worst option for them), and must be { x K }  
or a pair that contains  x K  for individual 1 (in order for him to pick  x K ). Hence,  
 ≠  ∪ i∈    i  , and  x K  ∉  f   eff (θ), as claimed.

Weak implementability of  f   bre , and the fact that  f   bre  is not Nash implementable 
then follows from Proposition 3.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 6:
The result holds trivially when  contains only two elements, since individuals 

are rational in that case. It is thus assumed throughout the proof that  contains at 
least three elements.

For each θ ∈  Θ ∗ , let f (θ) be the set of options x for which one can find a collec-
tion (  i  ) i∈  of subsets of  such that |   i  | ≤ 2, x ∈  C i  (  i  , θ), for all i,   i  ∩   j  = {x}, 
for all i ≠ j, and  =  ∪ i∈    i  . This is simply a selection of     f    

eff , where each implicit 
opportunity set used to justify an option contains at most two elements. To check 
that f ⊆  f   par , let x ∈ f (θ) and suppose that there exists y such that y  ≻  i  θ  x, for all i. 
This means that x ∉  C i  ({x, y}, θ), for all i, but this contradicts the definition of x, 
since   j  = {x, y} for some j.

If |   | ≥ |   | − 1, then f (θ) ≠ ∅, for all θ ∈  Θ ∗ . To check this, define  x i  as one of 
the  ⪰  i  θ -minimal elements in   \{ x 1 , … ,  x i−1 }, by induction on i = 1, … , |   | − 1, 
and let x be the remaining element in   \{ x 1 , … ,  x |   |−1 }. Clearly, x ∈ f (θ) (using  
 i  = { x i  , x}, for all i = 1, … , |   | − 1, and   i  = {x}, for all i ≥ |   | − 1).

For each x ∈ f (θ), let (   i  x, θ    ) i∈  be a collection of subsets of  justifying why 
x ∈ f (θ). Clearly, the collection  = {     i  x, θ  | i ∈ , x ∈ f (θ), θ ∈ Θ} is consistent 
with f. Checking the other condition of Proposition 2B′ will prove that f is imple-
mentable.20 Let  x 1 , … ,  x |   |  be an enumeration of , and   i  = { x (i)mod |   | }, for each 
i ∈ . If x, θ are such that | {i ∈  | x ∈  C i  ({ x (i)mod |   | , x}, θ)} | ≥ |  | − 2, then for 
each y ∈  there exists i such that x ∈  C i  ({x, y}, θ) (since |  | ≥ 3|   |). Hence 
x ∈ f (θ) and f is implementable.

I now show, by contradiction, that  f   par  is not Nash implementable (independently 
of the number of individuals). Otherwise, let  be a collection of opportunity sets 
which is consistent with  f   par . Consider a state θ ∈  Θ ∗  at which the first individual 
ranks x strictly above all other options (according to pairwise choices), while other 
individuals have the opposite ranking. Suppose in addition that the first individual 
does not pick x out of sets which contain three or more options, while other individ-
uals are rational. The first condition of consistency implies that  O i  (x, θ) = {x}, for 
all i ≥ 2, while  O 1 (x, θ) contains x and at most one other element y. Consider then 
z ≠ x, y, and a rational state θ′ ∈  Θ ∗  where all individuals rank z top, and x second 
best. By consistency, x must belong to  f   par ( θ′   ), a contradiction.

Suppose now that |  | ≤ |   | − 2. I prove, by contradiction, that there is no selec-
tion of  f   par  that is Nash implementable. Otherwise, let f   be an implementable selec-
tion, and let  be a collection of opportunity sets which is consistent with f. Consider 
a state θ ∈  Θ ∗  where pairwise choices rank x as the top element for all  individuals, 

20 Proposition 2B does not apply, as  is not necessarily strongly consistent with f, and f need not respect 
unanimity.



2995de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

while they do not pick x out of sets that contain three or more options. Hence 
f (θ) = x, and  O i  (x, θ) contains x plus at most one other option, for each i, by the first 
consistency condition. Since |  | ≤ |   | − 2, there must exist y ∈   \( ∪ i   O i  (x, θ)).  
Consider then a rational state θ′ ∈  Θ ∗  where all individuals rank y top, and x  second 
best. By consistency, x must belong to f ( θ′   ), while f ( θ′   ) = y, a contradiction.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 7:
To show that  f   s.eff  extends strong Pareto, suppose that  γ i  (·, θ) is rational at θ, 

for each i, and let   i  be the union of { x i } with the (strict) lower contour set (in  ) 
of  x i  for i. By definition, x is strongly Pareto efficient at θ if and only if there is no 
allocation y ∈   \{x} such that for each j,  y j  =  x j  or  y j  belongs to the (strict) upper 
contour set of  x j  for j. This, in turn, is equivalent to: if y ∈   \{x}, then  y j  ∈   j \{ x j }, 
for some j. This is also equivalent to the existence of a collection (      i  ) i∈  of subsets 
of  justifying why x ∈  f   s.eff (θ), as desired. The necessary condition is trivial—take 
simply       i  =   i  for each i. For the sufficient condition, notice that  y j  ∈   j \{ x j } if  y j  ∈  
 j \{ x j }, since       j  ⊆   j  (given that  x j  =  γ j  (      j  , θ)).

Next I show that  f   s.eff  is Nash implementable in all housing markets. By defini-
tion, one can associate to any x ∈  f   s.eff (θ) a collection (   i  x, θ    ) i∈  of subsets of  such 
that  γ i  (   i  x, θ , θ) =  x i  , for each i ∈ , and for each y ∈   \{x} there exists j such that  
 y j  ∈    j  x, θ  \{ x j }. With      i  x, θ  = { y ∈  |  y i  ∈    i  x, θ   }, for each i, it is easy to check that 
 = {      i  x, θ  | i ∈ , x ∈  f   s.eff (θ), θ ∈ Θ} is consistent with  f   s.eff . Next, notice that if the 
allocation x ∈  is such that  x i  =  γ i  (, θ) for all individuals i except at most one 
individual j, then the collection of opportunity sets (  i  ) i∈  where   i  =  for all 
i ≠ j and   j  = { x j } justifies why x ∈  f   s.eff (θ).21 Hence  f   s.eff  respects unanimity,  is 
strongly consisent with  f   s.eff , and  f   s.eff  is Nash implementable, by Proposition 2B.

To conclude, I show that  f   s.eff  is the maximal implementable extension of strong 
Pareto. Suppose, to the contrary, that there exist an implementable extension f, and a 
state θ such that some option x belongs to f (θ), but not to  f   s.eff (θ). By Proposition 2A, 
let  be a collection of opportunity sets (subsets of   ) that is consistent with f. 
Let   i  = { z i  ∈  | z ∈  O i  (x, θ)}, for each i ∈ . Since x ∉  f   s.eff (θ), there must exist 
y ∈   \{x} such that  y i  ∉   i \{ x i }, for all i ∈ . Consider then any state  θ′  where each 
individual i is rational, ranking  y i  top best, and  x i  second best (when  x i  ≠  y i  , which 
happens for at least two individuals since y ≠ x). Notice that x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x, θ),  θ′   ), 
for all i, and hence x ∈ f ( θ′   ), a contradiction since f extends strong Pareto and x is 
not strongly Pareto efficient at  θ′ .

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 8:
To show that     f    s.eff  is Nash implementable, consider θ, x with x ∈     f    s.eff (θ). If 

x ∈  f   π (θ) for some enumeration π, then define   i  (x, θ) = { x j  | π( j) ≥ π(i)} and  
 O i  (x, θ) = { y ∈  |  y i  ∈   i  (x, θ)}. If x ∈     f    

s.eff (θ)\   f   π (θ), then there exists j such that  
x i  =  γ i  (, θ), for all i ≠ j. Define  O i  (x, θ) = , for all i ≠ j, and  O j  (x, θ) = {x}. 
It is easy to check that the resulting collection  is consistent with     f    s.eff . Strong 

21 To check condition (ii) in the definition of  f   s.eff , notice that if y ≠ x, then there are at least two individuals i 
and j such that  x i  ≠  y i  and  x j  ≠  y j  .



2996 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

consistency and unanimity follow from the fact that any allocation y for which there 
exists j such that  y i  =  γ i (, θ), for all i ≠ j, belongs to     f    

s.eff (θ), by definition.
I now check that     f    s.eff  coincides with strong Pareto when individuals are rational. 

As is well known, the set of allocations which are strongly Pareto efficient coincides 
with the set of outcomes from serial dictatorship in housing markets with rational 
individuals. It remains to show that any allocation x for which there exists j such that  
x i  =  γ i  (, θ), for all i ≠ j, is strongly Pareto efficient. Suppose instead that there 
exists a feasible allocation y such that y ≠ x and y weakly Pareto improves upon x. 
Given that y ≠ x and y is feasible, there exist at least two individuals i and j such that  
y i  ≠  x i  and  y j  ≠  x j  . Hence, both i prefer strictly  y i  over  x i  and j prefers strictly  y j  over  
x j  , which contradicts the definition of x.

Finally, let f  be an implementable extension of strong Pareto. I conclude the proof 
by showing that  f   SD  ⊆ f. Let x =  f   π (θ) for some state θ and some enumeration π of 
. Consider a state  θ′  where individuals are rational with i strictly preferring object  
x j  over  x i  , for all j such that π( j) < π(i), and strictly preferring  x i  over  x k  , for all k 
such that π(k) > π(i ). The allocation x is strongly Pareto efficient at  θ′ . Suppose on 
the contrary that there exists a feasible allocation y ≠ x that Pareto improves upon 
x. Let then j be the individuals for which π(i) is minimal among all i ’s who prefer 
strictly  y i  over  x i  at  θ′ . Notice that  y k  =  x k  for all individual k which precede j in π. 
Given j ’s preference at  θ′ , him preferring  y j  over  x i  implies that there exists k with 
π(k) < π( j) such that  y j  =  x k  . This contradicts the feasibility of y since both k and 
j consume the same object. This proves that x is strongly Pareto efficient at  θ′ , and 
hence x ∈ f ( θ′   ), since f extends strong Pareto. Applying Proposition 2A, let  be 
a collection of implicit opportunity sets that is consistent with f. I now prove that  
{  y i  ∈  | y ∈  O i  (x,  θ′   )} = { x j  | π( j) ≥ π(i)}, for all i ∈ . The fact that the former set 
is contained in the latter follows at once from the fact that x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x,  θ′   ),  θ′   ), 
for all i ∈ . To show the opposite inclusion, suppose on the contrary that there 
exist two individuals i and j such that π( j) < π(i) and there is no y ∈  O i  (x,  θ′   ) for 
which  y i  =  x j  . Consider then θ″ where individuals are rational, with the same prefer-
ences as in  θ′ , except that i ranks  x j  top best. Clearly, x ∈  C k ( O k (x,  θ′   ), θ″  ), for each 
k ∈ , and x ∈ f (θ″  ), by Proposition 2A. Yet x is Pareto dominated by the allocation 
z derived from x by exchanging individuals i and j  ’s objects:  z i  =  x j  ,  z j  =  x i  , and  
 z k  =  x k  for all k ≠ i, j. This contradicts the fact that f extends strong Pareto. We have 
thus shown that {  y i  ∈  | y ∈  O i  (x,  θ′   )} = { x j  | π( j) ≥ π(i)}, for all i ∈ . By defini-
tion of x,  x i  =  γ i  ({ x j  | π( j) ≥ π(i)}, θ), for all i ∈ . Hence x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x,  θ′   ), θ), for 
all i, and x ∈ f (θ), by Proposition 2A.

Extended Trading Cycle Procedure.—Start by identifying a set   1  of objects 
which coincides with the set of objects picked by individuals whose endowment 
belongs to   1  and whose opportunity set is . To check that such a set exists, draw 
an arc from individual i to individual j if i ’s choice from  is j ’s endowment. Sets as  
 1  correspond to cycles of this graph, hence the reference to “trading cycles.” The 
existence of a cycle follows from the fact that  is finite. Given such an   1 , look for 
a set   2  of different objects which coincides with the set of objects picked by indi-
viduals whose endowment belongs to   2  and whose opportunity set is \  1 . By 
iteration, the extended trading cycle procedure delivers a partition (  k  )  k=1  K   of  such 



2997de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

that   k  = { γ i  ( ∪  l=k  K     l  , θ) | i such that  h  i  ∗  ∈   k }, for each k. Individual i consumes the 
object  γ i  ( ∪  l=k(i)  K     l  , θ), where k(i ) is the index k such that  h  i  ∗  ∈   k  . When rational, 
individuals get to consume their most preferred object among those which remain 
at the time they exit in the procedure, hence the modifier “top” used by Shapley and 
Scarf. If individual choices satisfy IIA, then the outcome of the procedure does not 
depend on which cycle is realized at each round of the procedure when multiple 
such cycles exist. In the absence of rationality, however, the order of elimination 
may matter, and the procedure may deliver multiple allocations.22

LEMMA 1: An allocation is competitive if and only if it is an outcome of the extended 
trading cycle procedure.

PROOF: 
Let p be a competitive equilibrium whose associated outcome is x: i.e.,  

 x i  =  γ i  ( B i  ( p), θ). Define   1  as the set of objects which are most expensive,  
 2  as the set of objects which are most expensive among remaining objects, 
etc. If an individual i ’s endowment belongs to   k  , then  B i  ( p) =  ∪  l=k  K     l  and  
 x i  =  γ i  ( ∪  l=k  K     l , θ). For each h ∈   1 , there exists i such that  x i  = h. Given that only 
individuals whose endowment belongs to   1  can afford objects in   1 , it must be  
that  h  i  ∗  ∈   1 . Hence   1  ⊆ { x i  |  h  i  ∗  ∈   1 }. Given that both sets have the same cardi-
nality, the inclusion must be an equality. Applying this argument inductively, it fol-
lows that   k  = { x i  |  h  i  ∗  ∈   k }, for each k, as desired.

I now prove that any allocation x obtained via the extended trading cycle proce-
dure must be competitive. Let (  k  )  k=1  K   be the partition of objects which emerges 
from the extended trading cycle procedure. Consider the price vector p, with 
p(h) = K + 1 − k(h), where k(h) is the index k such that h ∈   k  . Hence  B i  ( p)  
=  ∪  l=k( h  i  ∗ )  

K
    l  ,  x i  =  γ i  (B( p), θ), for each i, and   k  = { x i  | i such that  h  i  ∗  ∈   k }, for 

each k. Hence x is a competitive allocation.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 9:
Existence follows from Lemma 1, since the extended trading cycle procedure 

delivers at least one allocation in each state.
As for multiplicity, consider the following housing market. Individuals suffer 

from a status quo bias when they are overwhelmed by too many options:  γ i  (, θ)  
=  h  i  ∗  when  contains m alternatives in addition to  h  i  ∗  (where m is a positive integer 
smaller than |  |). Otherwise, they pick a choice by maximizing preferences. The 
allocation where all individuals keep their endowments is competitive (e.g., with 
all prices equal to 1). Let now   be any set of at most m individuals, and let  x   be 
the unique competitive allocation which prevails when trade occurs only among 
members of . This allocation can be derived by applying Shapley and Scarf’s top 
trading cycle procedure since individuals maximize their preferences when facing 
opportunity sets with fewer than m objects. The allocation y that coincides with  x   for 
members of , while other individuals consume their endowments, is  competitive. 

22 Bade (2008) offers a first analysis of this extended trading cycle procedure. She shows that resulting allocations 
(which she does not relate to competitive allocations) are efficient and belong to the core associated to Bernheim 
and Rangel’s (2009) extended revealed preferences (which are larger sets than  f   s.eff  and  f   s.core  respectively).

Indeed, let  p   be prices supporting  x   for , and let  
_
 p   be a price that is larger than 

the maximal component of  p   . Then y is supported by the price vector q, where  
 q i  =  p i  , for all i ∈ , and  q i  =  

_
 p  , for all i ∈   \. Clearly,  x   ≠  h    ∗   for many prefer-

ence profiles, and hence it is possible to have multiple competitive allocations.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 10:
(i) To show that competitive allocations at θ belong to  f   s.eff (θ), let x be such a 

competitive allocation, with associated prices p. Observe that p( x i ) = p( h  i  ∗ ), for 
all i. Indeed, p( x i ) ≤ p( h  i  ∗ ), for all i, since  x i  ∈  B i  ( p), from which the equality fol-
lows, since  ∑  i∈  

 
   p( x i ) =  ∑  i∈  

 
   p( h  i  ∗ ) (given that { x i  | i ∈  } = { h  i  ∗  | i ∈  }). Let then  

  i  =  B i  ( p), for each i. Hence  x i  =  γ i  (  i  , θ), by definition. It remains to show that 
for each y ∈   \{x} there exists i such that  y i  ∈   i \{ x i }. Otherwise, there exists 
y ∈   \{x} such that for each i, either  y i  =  x i  , or  y i  ∉  B i  ( p). Let  be the set of 
individuals i such that  x i  ≠  y i  . Notice that  is nonempty since x ≠ y. We get  
 ∑  i∈  

 
   p( h  i  ∗ ) =  ∑  i∈ \  

 
   p( y i ) +  ∑  i∈  

 
   p( h  i  ∗ ) <  ∑  i∈  

 
   p( y i ) =  ∑  i∈  

 
   p( h  i  ∗ ), a contradic-

tion. The first equality follows from p( h  i  ∗ ) = p( x i ), as shown earlier, and  x i  =  y i  for 
i ∈   \. The inequality follows from p( h  i  ∗ ) < p(  y i ) for i such that  y i  ∉  B i  ( p). The 
last equality follows from {  y i  | i ∈  } = { h  i  ∗  | i ∈  }.

I now show that the extension of the first fundamental theorem of welfare eco-
nomics does not hold with     f    s.eff  instead of  f   s.eff . Consider a housing market with at 
least four individuals, and a state θ such that  γ 1 (, θ) =  h  2  ∗  if and only if  =  or  
{ h  2  ∗ },  γ 2 (, θ) =  h  1  ∗  if and only if  =  or { h  1  ∗ }, and each individual i ≥ 3 is ratio-
nal, ranking object  h  1  ∗  top best,  h  2  ∗  second best, and  h  i+1  ∗   third best (with the conven-
tion I + 1 = 3). By Lemma 1, there exists a unique competitive allocation x, with  
 x 1  =  h  2  ∗ ,  x 2  =  h  1  ∗ , and  x i  =  h  i+1  ∗  , for each i ≥ 3. Yet x ∉     f    

s.eff (θ). Suppose, by contra-
diction, first that x =  f   π (θ), for some enumeration π of . No individual i with i ≥ 3 
can come first or second, as his or her preference would result in him or her consum-
ing  h  1  ∗  or  h  2  ∗ , which is different from  x i  . Then the second individual in the enumera-
tion π (either 1 or 2) picks an object different than the one he or she is allocated 
under x. Next, there cannot be an individual j such that  x i  =  γ i  (, θ) for all i ≠ j, as 
at least one such i will be greater or equal to 3 and that individual picks  h  1  ∗  out of  
instead of  x i  . Hence, x ∉     f    

s.eff , as desired.
(ii) I start by proving that allocations in     f    s.eff  are competitive for some initial 

endowments. Consider a state θ and an allocation x such that x =  f   π (θ), for some 
enumeration π of . Suppose then that i ’s endowment is object  x i  . Then, x constitutes 
a competitive allocation which is supported by the price vector p( x i ) = I + 1 − π(i ), 
for each i ∈ . Suppose now that there exists j such that  x i  =  γ i  (, θ), for all i ≠ j. 
Then x constitutes a competitive allocation when j ’s endowment is  x j  (other endow-
ments can be set arbitrarily). Indeed, it is supported by the prices p( x j ) = 1 and  
p( x i ) = 2, for all i ≠ j.

Next I show that there exists θ, x such that x ∈  f   s.eff (θ) and yet x is not competitive 
for any reallocation of endowments. Consider for instance a state where individuals 
i = 1, … , I − 1 suffer from a status quo bias when too many options are available:  
γ i  (, θ) =  h  i  ∗ , for all i ≤ I − 1. On the other hand, individuals’ choices are derived 
from the maximization of a strict preference when opportunity sets are smaller, 
with individual i ranking  h  i+1  ∗   top best. To make the example as simple as possible, 



2999de clippel: behavioral implementationvol. 104 no. 10

assume that any such individual is rational when facing no more than I − 1 options. 
Individual I is fully rational, systematically maximizing a preference ordering that 
ranks  h  1  ∗  top best. The allocation x where  x i  =  h  i+1  ∗   for each i (with the convention 
I + 1 = 1), belongs to  f   s.eff (θ). To check this, take   i  =  \{ h  1  ∗ }, for all i < I, and  
 I  = . Notice that  γ i  (  i  , θ) =  h  i+1  ∗  , for each i. Take any y ∈   \{x}. There must 
exist at least two individuals, i and k, such that  y i  ≠  x i  and  y k  ≠  x k  . If either i or k 
equals I, then we have found an individual j such that  y j  ∈   j \{ x j }, since   I  = . If 
both i ≠ I and k ≠ I, then at least one of them receives an object which is different 
from  h  1  ∗ . Again, we have found an individual j such that  y j  ∈   j \{ x j }, and we have 
thus proved that x ∈  f   s.eff (θ). On the other hand, there is no allocation of endowments 
which make x competitive. Suppose on the contrary that the allocation of endow-
ments w and the price vector p makes x competitive. Some object(s) must be among 
those which are most expensive, and individual(s) owning it (or them) under w can 
afford any object. Given that  x i  ≠  h  i  ∗  for each i < I, there must be some objects that 
i cannot afford, and hence  h  i  ∗  ’s price is not maximal. Hence p( h  I  ∗ ) > p( h  i  ∗ ), for all 
i < I. This contradicts  x I−1  =  h  I  ∗ , since I − 1 cannot afford this object. 

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 11:
To show that  f   s.core  extends the strong core, suppose that each individual choice 

function  γ i  (·, θ) is rational at θ. For each i, let   i  be the union of { x i } with the 
(strict) lower contour set (in ) of  x i  for i. By definition, x belongs to the strong core 
at θ if and only if there is no coalition  and no allocation y ∈ (  )\{ x  } such that 
for each j ∈ ,  y j  =  x j  or  y j  belongs to the (strict) upper contour set of  x j  for j. This, 
in turn, is equivalent to: for all coalition , if y ∈  (  )\{ x  }, then  y j  ∈   j \{ x j }, for 
some j. This is also equivalent to the existence of a collection (      i  ) i∈  of subsets of 
 justifying why x ∈  f   s.core (θ), as desired. The necessary condition is trivial—take 
simply       i  =   i  for each i. For the sufficient condition, observe that  y j  ∈   j \{ x j } if  
 y j  ∈       j \{ x j }, since       j  ⊆   j  (given that  x j  =  γ j  (      j  , θ)).

Let’s check that  f   s.core  is Nash implementable in all housing markets. By defini-
tion, one can associate to any x ∈  f   s.core (θ) a collection (     i  x, θ    ) i∈  of subsets of  such 
that  γ i  (     i  x, θ , θ) =  x i  , for each i ∈ , and for each  ⊆  and each y ∈  ()\{ x  },  
there exists j ∈  for which      i  x, θ  \{ x j } contains  y j  . Define  O i  (x, θ) as {x} union the 
set of y ∈  such that  y i  ∈      i  x, θ ,  y j  =  h  i  ∗  where j is the individual such that  y i  =  h  j  ∗ , 
and  y k  =  h  k  ∗ , for all k ≠ i, j. The set  O i  (x, θ) is constructed so that the set of objects 
that i can get by picking elements of  O i  (x, θ) is precisely      i  x, θ . In addition, ele-
ments y of  O i  (x, θ) which are different from x are constructed so as to minimize the 
number of trades needed to give  y i  to individual i.

By construction,  = { O i  (x, θ) | i ∈ , x ∈  f   s.core (θ), θ ∈ Θ} is consistent with  
f   s.core . Next, notice that if the allocation x ∈  is such that  x i  =  γ i  (, θ) for all i, 
then the collection of opportunity sets (  i  ) i∈  where   i  =  for all i justifies why 
x ∈  f   s.core (θ). Hence  f   s.core  respects unanimity. To show that  is strongly consistent 
with  f   s.core , consider an allocation x ∈  for which  x i  =  γ i  (, θ) for all individuals 
i ≠ j, and x ∈  C j  ( O j  ( x′ ,  θ′   ),  θ j ) for some x′ ∈  f   s.core ( θ′   ). I check that x ∈  f   s.core (θ),  
using the collection (  i  ) i∈  of implicit opportunity sets defined by  W i  = , for 
i ≠ j, and   j  =      j   x  ′ ,  θ  ′  . Otherwise, there exist a coalition  and y ∈  (  )\{ x  }  
such that  y i  ∉   i \{ x i }, for all i ∈ . This is possible only if j ∈ ,  y i  =  x i  for all  



3000 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW OCTObER 2014

i ∈  \{ j},  y j  ≠  x j  ,  y j  ∉      j   x  ′ ,  θ  ′  , and x ≠  x′ . Then  x l  =  h  j  ∗  for the individual l such that  
x j  =  h  l  ∗ , and  x k  =  h  k  ∗ , for all k ∈  \{k, l}, since x ∈  C j  ( O j  ( x′ ,  θ′   ), θ). Feasibility of 
y, which coincides with x for members of  different from j, implies that  y j  =  h  l  ∗   
=  x j  , a contradiction. Hence  is strongly consistent with  f   s.core , and it is Nash 
implementable, by Proposition 2B.

Finally, I show that  f   s.core  is the maximal implementable extension of the strong 
core. Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists an implementable extension f, and 
a state θ such that some option x belongs to f (θ), but not to  f   s.core (θ). By Proposi-
tion 2A, let  be a collection of opportunity sets (subsets of  ) which is consis-
tent with f. Let   i  = { z i  ∈  | z ∈  O i  (x, θ)}, for each i ∈ . Since x ∉  f   s.core (θ), there 
must exist  ⊆  and y ∈  (  )\{ x  } such that  y i  ∉   i \{ x i }, for all i ∈ . Consider 
then any state  θ′  where each individual i is rational, with an underlying strict prefer-
ence which ranks  x i  top if i ∈   \, and ranks  y i  top best, and  x i  second best (when  
x i  ≠  y i  , which happens for at least one individual since y ≠ x) if i ∈ . Notice that  
x ∈  C i  ( O i  (x, θ),  θ′   ), for all i, and hence, x ∈ f ( θ′   ). Yet x does not belong to the 
strong core at  θ′  (since all the members of  prefer weakly y over x, some with a 
strict preference), thereby contradicting the fact that f extends strong Pareto.
